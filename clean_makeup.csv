Makeup,"Learning to do your eyeshadow involves so many different skills but there are some things that are just difficult to do (for me anyways) - what do you find most tricky to do when it comes to applying eyeshadow?I’ve gotten better over the last few months with applying eyeshadow (which I'm sooo happy about, feeling more and more confident wearing it each time!) but still find some techniques tricky such as creating a cut crease because I have uneven eyelids.

Makeup,"Oily eyelids and eyeshadow troublePlease help me in my struggle because I feel that I may never manage to have an eye makeup on my eyelids for a whole day. I have little bit hooded eyes and oily lids so it's the worst possible combination.

I tried cheaper and more expensive eyesahow bases too (MAC, Urban Decay, Artdeco, etc.) but I just can't find the best for me. I usually need to add concealer on top of the base beacuse of the thin skin around my eyes, but when I don't apply concealer on the top, doesn't make a difference either in durability. In an hour, the eyeshadow just doesn't stay and the base is on my eyelids as a white stripe.

Makeup,"Rare Beauty Blush disappears from my cheeksHi,  
I don't know if I'm doing something wrong, because everyone loves these liquid blushes. I've had samples in Joy and Bliss and I have a full-size of Happy and the same thing happens each time. My order of putting on make-up is: primer, foundation, concealer, liquid blush, liquid highlight, setting powder, powdered bronzer. I use sponge for liquid products. Every time I use a rare beauty liquid blush it first gives off insane pigmentation and then it fades away with time.

Makeup,"Alternative to Makeup Forever Ultra HD Foundation Y205?It looks like Makeup Forever has discontinued the Ultra HD Foundation in order to replace it with their new HD Skin line, and I am freaking out! Y205 was my holy grail foundation. It matched my skin tone perfectly, which is so so difficult to find for pale skin, and it was really hydrating for my dry skin. The lightest shade of their new foundation does not appear to be as light as Y205, and I have also read some comments that it is pretty drying.

Makeup,"Cool toned eyeshadow palette for pale skin?Hi, I’m on the hunt for a good cook toned eyeshadow palette for pale skin. I’ve noticed a lot of the brown and taupe kinda colours in the palettes I own run a bit warm on me, which usually isn’t a problem but I’ve been dying to do a more classic eyeshadow look with a grey-brown tone in the crease. 

I’ve seen a few palettes that look cool toned but I couldn’t tell if they’d swatch warmer without buying them, and then others look too cool as they’re just grey. I hope I’m making sense in what kind of shades I’m looking for? Cool taupes but not outright grey or silver eyeshadow, but also not the same usual warm brown transition tones. 

If anyone can suggest any palettes that are properly cool toned and also reasonably priced (and available in the UK!) I’d be very grateful.

Makeup,"Sleeping over at my boyfriend place for the first time! He has never seen me without makeup!Hi! F(19) here!
I am in a relationship with a truly wonderful man. He’s kind and deeply cares for me and I could not wish for a better boyfriend.

Next week, I’m going to sleep over at his place for the very first time. I do wear a lot of makeup, and I have never had a boyfriend before- which results in the fact that a man has never seen me without makeup before.

This makes me feel very insecure. I’m quite afraid that he will not think I’m beautiful when I’m not wearing any makeup. On top of that, I shaved off the tails of my eyebrows (to draw on my eyebrows more easily)- and am afraid I will look silly in front of him! 

How do I deal with my insecurity?

Makeup,"why is my concealer separating &amp; splotchey or caking? I've tried everything (i think). is there a different formulation?
Im 46 and have puffiness, and sine texture in the inner corner of my under eye. 

I'm not very familiar with cosmetics. Trying to conceal my bags started my journey into fun eye shadow...

I have recessed tear troughs, which cause more shadow than 

I have tried about 15 concealers (seriously) and all of them start to either separate as i put them on, or after.

It also enhances some lines-but-not-quite-wrinkles

I have watched multiple vids &amp; tried different hacks.

Moisturizer then eyeshadow primer then stippling or patting concealer.

No eyeshadow primer and the above (just ""straight-up application"")

Putting setting spray on my brush.

Tapping setting spray with a beauty blender or fingers.

Setting powder (disaster).

Thin layers.
Using brush or finger.

Sometimes I can pat over it with a tad of primer and re-emulsify it.

**What i have resorsted to** is using eyeshadow primer and then using a skin colored eyeshadow.

It looks the best, but i dont get the coverage I need.

I have used liquid and cream concealers.

I dont know what i am doing wrong.

I'm wondering if it is eye cream, but i have used a few different brands..

I use about a lentil between both eyes.

I need something to depuff my bags (my current has caffine, Matryxl 3000, Eyliss, Haloxyl &amp; Tranexamic Acid.

Makeup,"Face makeup routine for 30+I recently turned 30 and my complexion is suddenly changing. I used to have combo skin with frequent breakouts on my chin. My go-to makeup was powder foundation (medium coverage) mostly to cover my acne marks. Now my acne is minimal, and my face wash seems to be controlling my scars (thank you Glossier!)…whenever I use powder foundation, it turns out looking cakey and highlighting the wrinkles around my eyes. I’ve also tried some light face tints (Glossier) which make me feel greasy, but maybe I’m putting too much on? Anyway, I now feel like my skin looks best without foundation, but I like putting on makeup when I go out or go to special events.

Makeup,"help out a girl that's now learning how to put on makeupHello everyone! I'm in my 20s and I've just started to be intrested in wearing makeup- especially eyeshadow. My eyes are semi hooded and pretty oily and I've got a few questions. I've purchased the essence I love color intensifying eyeshadow base but it doesn't seem to be doing much. After a few hours of wearing eyeshadow it smears (especially on my hood).

I own the sephora gleaming stones palette that has a powdered base eye primer and I'm not sure how to use it- can I layer it over the essence eyeshadow base? Will it do anything? Do you have a certain base/primer youd recommend? Also, can someone explain the difference between a ""base eye primer"" and a ""eyeshadow base""?

Makeup,"Under eye cream suggestionsI may be in the wrong sub, but I don’t know who to ask. 

I do not like to wear makeup except on extra special occasions and have gone through Acutane to correct my acne issues. But I’ve always had what I call shiners (dark circles under my eyes almost like black eyes) and puffiness under both eyes. It seems to be genetic from my parents. 

I’d like to find a daily under eye cream that helps with this so that I don’t have to wear concealer. I’d also love to not spend a fortune on it if possible.

...... 

🔺️ PALETTE: Natasha Denona - Love Palette✌ 

...... 

🔺️ ACQUIRED: purchased myself 

...... 

👁 LOOK CREATED: '1/3 Cut-Crease' 

...... 

▪️ PACKAGING &amp; DESIGN: each pan holds 1.28g of product, rectangular-shaped pans, luxurious plastic casing packaging, bi-fold, palette name &amp; brand is on cover, luxe-weight, magnetic closure system, medium rectangle shape, large mirror inside, tried a heavy magnet &amp; pans ARE removable and able to be shuffled, shade nomenclature is designated southward of each shade

...... 

▪️ COUNTRY OF ORIGIN: Italy

...... 

▪️ DESIGNATION: red/pink toned 

...... 

▪️ DEXTERITY CONCERNS: none

&lt;$2=excellent; $3-$4=affordable; $5-$8=meh; $9-$15=expensive; &gt;$16=very expensive 


• Comparing this palette to similar products available on the market, the price-per-shade is 'meh'. Additionally - this palette has a higher cost-per-gram, as compared to other palettes I've previously reviewed. 

......


🔎 REVIEW: 


🔸️PATCHINESS: experienced patchiness while using the deep matte purple shade 'Trust' 


🔸️CREASING: no visible creasing after 6-hours of wear


🔸️BLENDABILITY: very easy to blend-out 


🔸️KICK-BACK/FALL-OUT: 


+ some shades had kick-back while others didn't 


+ experienced very little fall-out, the most being from shimmer shade 'Lifetime' 


🔸️COLOR-STORY CRITIQUE: 


+ this palette inholds the nice 'light-to-dark' gradient that I always look for. The included shades range from light to midtone to deep. There are a few options available to create depth in your look, which drastically improves a palette's versatility (i.e., the types/amount of varying looks you can create). 


+ I don't think any of the shades are repetitive - each one is different and serves a purpose 


+ there are no traditional neutral 'transition shades' included in this particular color-story. 


+ the formula balance ratio in this palette is 8:7 (mattes to non-mattes), &amp; I think a 53% / 47% formula split is fairly balanced, &amp; provides enough range-of-use. I prefer either fairly balanced layouts, OR matte-heavy spreads. 


+ I classify this as a red/pink toned palette, &amp; I don't find it particularly unique. I own several crossover shades in my collection. 


+ there is NOT a matte black in this palette, which I always prefer - as it deems any palette truly 'universal'. 


+ throughout exploring this entire palette, I DID encounter a 'dud' shade. The shade 'Dream' is technically part of the metallics, but it is awful. It is not on par with any of the other metallic shades. It lacks movement (as well as any shine) in the formula. It's also very difficult to maneuver and work with. 


+ there is no decorative embossing on any of the included shades 

...... 

🔸️FORMULA EVALUATION: 

// 

+ | MATTES |: 

• some of the mattes are a 'cream-to-powder based' matte formula 

• I didn't have any trouble with the mattes at all 

• the formula is quite soft and thin 

• they work well in creating a gradient 

• I found it very easy to layer them 

• each shade applied darker than the tone/color that they appear as in their pan. 

• the matte color selections work well together, it's easy to formulate a look 

• this is a more 'directly pigmented' formula (in lieu of being 'buildable'), making it more difficult to manage and control the formula 

// 

+ | SHIMMERS |: 

• these shimmers are all very chunky in texture, and quite thick 

• there are two duochrome shimmers included 

• each one of the shimmers is highly reflective 

• each shimmer has an intense base pigment, allowing them to be multifunctional 

• these do not require a lot of building; one layer suffices 

• works perfectly well with your finger, a dry brush, or even with a dampened brush. I didn't notice any significant differences between application type 

// 

+ | METALLICS |: 

• each one is very smooth and thin 

• there is no glitter in this formula 

• has an intense base pigment, so they are not sheer shades 

• very high-shine 

• works perfectly well with your finger, a dry brush, or even with a dampened brush. I didn't notice any significant differences between application type 

...... 

🔸️PACKAGING: 


+ I love the packaging design of this palette! Plastic casings are my favorite, as the look great, plus you get the added security of better shadow protection. 


+ I do think this packaging design is a great representation of the brand (Natasha Denona), as it's completely inline with similar products offered in the range. 

...... 

🔸️COMMENTARY: I know it's a little out-of-season, but I actually just got this palette so I was really excited to use it! I think today's eye look is fun, and definitely a great representation of this palette's versatility. I am on a mission to collect all the ND midi-sized palettes, and this is my first. In my experience, the Natasha Denona formula has really been hit-or-miss, but this palette was a score! I am truly very happy with it. I'm not going to rate it an absolute 'A', because I did have some patchiness, plus that dud shade. 

...... 

▪️FINAL RECOMMENDATION: (recommend) 

+ extremely easy to blend
+ all the colors work well together
+ exposure to luxury formulas at a lower cost 

...... 

+ Favorite Shade: Soul 

- Least Favorite Shade: Dream 

...... 

🚦 RATING: B 

...... 

⭐ RATING LEGEND: 

A = totally wow'd me 

B = not the best, but I like it 

C = personal bias, nothing wrong w/ product 

D = this didn't work out for me 

F = I totally hate this

after hour of wear blendability very easy to blend out kick back fall out some shade had kick back while others didn experienced very little fall out the most being from shimmer shade lifetime color story critique this palette inholds the nice light to dark gradient that always look for the included shade range from light to midtone to deep there are few option available to create depth in your look which drastically improves palette versatility the type amount of varying look you can create don think any of the shade are repetitive each one is different and serf purpose there are no traditional neutral transition shade included in this particular color story the formula balance ratio in this palette is matte to non matte amp think formula split is fairly balanced amp provides enough range of use prefer either fairly balanced layout or matte heavy spread classify this a red pink toned palette amp don find it particularly unique own several crossover shade in my collection there is not matte black in this palette which always prefer a it deems any palette truly universal throughout exploring this entire palette did encounter dud shade the shade dream is technically part of the metallic but it is awful it is not on par with any of the other metallic shade it lack movement a well a any shine in the formula it also very difficult to maneuver and work with there is no decorative embossing on any of the included shade formula evaluation mattes some of the matte are cream to powder based matte formula didn have any trouble with the matte at all the formula is quite soft and thin they work well in creating gradient found it very easy to layer them each shade applied darker than the tone color that they appear a in their pan the matte color selection work well together it easy to formulate look this is more directly pigmented formula in lieu of being buildable making it more difficult to manage and control the formula shimmers these shimmer are all very chunky in texture and quite thick there are two duochrome shimmer included each one of the shimmer is highly reflective each shimmer ha an intense base pigment allowing them to be multifunctional these do not require lot of building one layer suffices work perfectly well with your finger dry brush or even with dampened brush didn notice any significant difference between application type metallics each one is very smooth and thin there is no glitter in this formula ha an intense base pigment so they are not sheer shade very high shine work perfectly well with your finger dry brush or even with dampened brush didn notice any significant difference between application type packaging love the packaging design of this palette plastic casing are my favorite a the look great plus you

Makeup,"In Need of Incredibly Lazy-Girl MakeupHi beauty cuties. I am a makeup-for-fun person, and might do a full face three times a year, but for a daily look, it's mascara and tinted lip balm. 

I am not well-versed in all the brands, types, etc, so I am hoping for some outside help!  I started a new full-time job, and I have sleep issues, so sometimes I wake up and look kind of...dead. I'm looking for a blush, maybe a stick-type, that I can just dab on and rub in with my fingers and an eyeshadow that I can also just smudge on with my fingers and go. If there's a blush that is also an eyeshadow, even better. I have executive functioning issues as well, so the easier something is, the better, because otherwise, I tend to get overwhelmed.

Makeup,"Can't Find a Product?Recently was in an Ulta store, and Nyx had a display up for their new Contour/Blush sticks, and right next to that was a spot for a micro Highlighting Pencil.  They did not have any of the micro pencils in stock.
So, I went to the Ulta website and was hoping to order some of the micro highlighters.  Couldn't find it.  I ALSO cannot find them on the Nyx website!  Any ideas what the heck is going on?

Makeup,"Treating my ADHD with makeupSo I’m 37 I’ve been wearing makeup for many many years but never once until recently attempted anything other than neutrals and eventually I stopped wearing anything outside of a little eyeliner until recently. 

Call it just another hyperfocus but let me just explain how I know this one is here to stay. I’ve struggled my entire life and didn’t get diagnosed until 35 years old. Starting meds was literally life changing. And about 2 weeks ago I found that doing my makeup was almost as life changing. NOW this does not mean that I am suggesting to swap meds for makeup lol. 

For the last 3 years I struggled more than I had in my entire life. Ended up with an anxiety diagnosis along with OCD and ADHD. Unfortunately my OCD was the weird kind instead of the productive kind. 

Anyway. 

Even with my diagnosis I had to beg for treatment for my adhd because they were concerned it would make my anxiety worse. Big Surprise it got better. 

Life story out of the way….about 3 weeks ago I started trying out the Curly Girl method because I suspected my hair texture changed after the baby. I was right and now my hair looks amazing. So my thought was it’s silly to have this great hair and nothing on my face lol. 

That’s what led me to take advantage of the babies nap time and start experimenting with eyeshadow pallets and really push the boundaries of what I’m comfortable with. I noticed that once I’ve finished getting ready for the day I feel AMAZING. My mood is instantly better and I get everything done that I usually procrastinate on with no hesitation. 

I think what’s happening is that I’m prioritizing an hour to sometimes 2 hours to myself. It’s just me in a quiet space doing something that’s productive (rather than doom scrolling Reddit). That basically means I have an opportunity to hyperfocus on hygiene, have quiet time to collect my thoughts and plan out my day, and I get little shots of dopamine throughout the day when I glance at my makeup. 

Not to mention the combinations are limitless so I’ll never get bored with it! 


It might sound crazy but honestly my house has never been so clean and my problem with impulse buying has chilled because a new piece of makeup at a time is relatively affordable even the high end stuff and it makes me want to go straight home to play with it","['Treating', 'my', 'ADHD', 'with', 'makeupSo', 've', 'been', 'wearing', 'makeup', 'for', 'many', 'many', 'years', 'but', 'never',

Makeup,"Depotting and repotting urban decay eyeshadowHi all, I’m not sure if this is the right place to post this but I was wondering if anyone had any advice/ experiencing about depotting and repotting urban decay palettes (specially naked 3, cherry, honey, born to run, Wild West and the Game of Thrones palette).

I’m moving abroad at the end of the summer and can’t take them all with me in their original packaging due to space and weight so was thinking of somehow combining them into one palette. How easy is this to do? From my understanding you can either pop the pans out or break the product up and repress it. I’m a bit worried that the heat needed to take out the whole pan or the alcohol potentially needed to repot may impact the formula. Is this the case?

Makeup,"Random q—can wearing faux lashes (strips) “too much” cause thinning of lashes?I wear makeup 5x a week for the five days I work. And I always wear fake lashes, they’re my vice, lol.

Makeup,"Allergic reaction to Ilia Beauty’s liquid powder eyeshadow??So about 4 days ago, I noticed some uncomfortable itchyness on my neck. The next morning, I have splotchy hives in a number of spots of my body - mostly the back of my neck, my arms and my face and eyelids. I’ve been taking Benedryl and using hydrocortisone to calm the hive but really to no avail. I’ve been racking my brain this whole time to try to figure out what could have been the cause, and I finally remembered that on that morning I used an old eyeshadow that I haven’t picked up in a pretty long time - maybe like 2 years? Ilia Beauty’s liquid powder eye tint (shade is mystic). 

Jw If anyone has had a similar experience? It could be bc the product is so old and I shouldn’t have used it in the first place, but it’s supposed to be a clean brand so I’m a bit unsure. It’s the only thing out of the norm that I can think of though. Any advice?

Makeup,"Most of my makeup expired during the pandemic (as in almost a year ago) — now I need new stuff.I’m oily-prone so I’m leaning towards a powder foundation. Should I use a brush or the white pad they generally include? 

Can you use liquid concealer w powder foundation? I’ve heard good things about Nars! 

A good pigmented bronzer and blush would also be great. I’ve heard Rare Beauty is good — who else?

What’s a good large light fluffy brush for either light bronzer over certain parts or for blotting powder?

Any tips would be appreciated! I’ve barely done my makeup in 2 years

Makeup,"Sheer Glitter Eyeshadow?Hi everyone! I’ve been looking for the perfect sheer, neutral toned glitter eyeshadow, I’m eyeing the Fenty Diamond Bomb but it’s a bit pricey, if I could find something a bit cheaper that’d be great! I’ve looked at a lot online and maybe the pictures don’t do them justice but I just can’t seem to find ‘the one’ lol. 

Ideally:
-It’d have no base color so I can wear it over color or on its own 
-Buildable
-Not too silver/gold (my skin is fair/light but pretty neutral toned maybe a tiny bit yellow/warm tones)

I recently got Urban Decay moondust in the cosmic shade and it’s a little too silver, I was hoping for something a little more ‘nude’ or beige maybe? But I do like it other than that.

Makeup,"Is my morning makeup routine good? My name is Patrick Bateman. I’m 27 years old. I believe in taking care of myself and a balanced diet and rigorous exercise routine. In the morning if my face is a little puffy I’ll put on an ice pack while doing stomach crunches. I can do 1000 now. After I remove the ice pack I use a deep pore cleanser lotion. In the shower I use a water activated gel cleanser, then a honey almond body scrub, and on the face an exfoliating gel scrub. Then I apply an herb-mint facial mask which I leave on for 10 minutes while I prepare the rest of my routine. I always use an after shave lotion with little or no alcohol, because alcohol dries your face out and makes you look older.

Makeup,"SuggestionsHi everyone, I’m looking for suggestions on affordable make-up brands. This is what I’m looking for (all basics, foundation, concealer, blush, pencil eyeliner preferred, mascara):

1. I only wear make-up about 5-10 times a year, so definitely looking for something affordable as I will not get through it all before tossing it (I follow the 1-2yr old rule). 

2. I need something that won’t run/smear but is not impossible to remove. I use baby wipes, water or lotion to remove make-up.

3. Good for SENSITIVE skin. I have neither oily or dry skin (it’s “normal” whatever that means) but I break out in rashes with a lot of products - not allergic just sensitive.

4. NOT looking for bronzers or highlights? (Is that a thing?) 

5. Mascara that won’t make my eyelashes look fake, just something to pop my eye color

6. I am a fall tone, I have light tan skin, hazel eyes and brown hair so any other suggestions on this topic would be appreciated!

Makeup,"Foundation shades for olive skin, but super pale?Hi!

I'm struggling for years to find a foundation shade for myself and I'm kind of getting convinced there is no such thing.

My skin tone is basically pale yellow, and every foundation I've tried has been too orange/pink. The closest matches so far have been NYX Total control pro drop foundation in shade Vanilla and Essence Pretty Natural in shade 040 Neutral Vanilla, but they both are still too pink.

Does anyone know any foundation that is even more yellow or is my only saviour those color adjusting drops?","['Foundation', 'shades', 'for', 'olive', 'skin', 'but', 'super', 'pale', 'Hi', 'struggling', 'for', 'years', 'to', 'find', 'foundation', 'shade', 'for', 'myself', 'and', 'kind', 'of', 'getting', 'convinced', 'there', 'is', 'no', 'such', 'thing', 'My', 'skin', 'tone', 'is', 'basically', 'pale', 'yellow', 'and', 'every', 'foundation', 've', 'tried', 'has', 'been', 'too', 'orange', 'pink', 'The', 'closest', 'matches', 'so', 'far', 'have', 'been', 'NYX', 'Total', 'control', 'pro', 'drop', 'foundation', 'in', 'shade', 'Vanilla', 'and', 'Essence', 'Pretty', 'Natural', 'in', 'shade', 'Neutral', 'Vanilla', 'but', 'they', 'both', 'are', 'still', 'too', 'pink', 'Does', 'anyone', 'know', 'any', 'foundation', 'that', 'is', 'even', 'more', 'yellow', 'or', 'is', 'my', 'only', 'saviour', 'those', 'color', 'adjusting', 'drops']",foundation shade for olive skin but super pale hi struggling for year to find foundation shade for myself and kind of getting convinced there is no such thing my skin tone is basically pale yellow and every foundation ve tried ha been too orange pink the closest match so far have been nyx total control pro drop foundation in shade vanilla and essence pretty natural in shade neutral vanilla but they both are still too pink does anyone know any foundation that is even more yellow or is my only saviour those color adjusting drop
Makeup,"I feel like I’m not getting enough coverage with my make up and the more I apply the worse it looksMy current skincare routine is Cerave smoothing cleanser AM-PM. Occasionally I use a night time tea tree gel. I try to focus on using acne fighting products as I get a lot of closed spots and hormonal acne. 

For my make up I use the bare minerals original primer and loose powder foundation. I use the pixi setting spray which is the only saving grace. I really want to make my bare minerals foundation work as I love the concept and I’ve tried my best to follow all the tips for it. 

I take my time to blend and use their brush. I see so many YouTubers use the same powder foundation and it seems to glide nicely over their skin which is what I want. I want to use vegan/ natural products only. 


Any product recommendations would be great or tips on applying.

I blended it all pretty well. My mom walked in and she goes “ you look Asian”. The problem is that I’m not east Asian and I don’t want to appear as if I’m Asian fishing and don’t want to be offensive. Is this maybe because of my technique? I apply it on dark circles and come slightly down to neutralize my skin tone to blend it in better. Is there a different way to do this?

Makeup,"Am i making my skin worse?So I'm a guy and I recently started using products because simply I was going on a date with a girl I just met back in September, I started to break out the day before (typical) and I was searching for how to hide spots. I ended up finding out about tinted moisturizer and concealers

I bought a men's brand tinted moisturizer and concealer, both were awful quality and overpriced, but they worked just ok. They covered the redness a little. Don't recommend them

I switched to a cheap concealer, which hides my redness/spots so much better and takes 30 seconds to apply. I feel 10x better once I use it. I do also have a loreal tinted moisturizer, but rarely use it, maybe for meetings or interviews. Best thing is, nobody notices, even my closest friends

Ever since I started using products I've found that I've had spots/acne more consistently and more often since September/October. Before that I had very mild acne and I would have weeks were my skin was clear and no spots in sight

I've kind of relied or became addicted to using a concealer/tinted moisturizer. I suffer from PTSD and image issues and it helps me alot

Makeup,"Need foundation suggestionsMy skin has been changing over the past few months (thanks, menopause) and products that used to work beautifully are now not working for me. The Catrice Liquid HD foundation used to be my holy grail; now it gives me polka-dot pores no matter what primer I use (including pore filling and dimethicone primers).

 I decided to try the Sephora Best Skin Ever foundation because it got so many great reviews from people with different skin types, but the same thing happened. Regardless of the primer I use, it immediately sinks into my pores and gives me polka dots.

The only foundation I have on hand that works for me right now is the Physician's Formula Butter Believe it, but the shade match isn't great. Their previous foundation (The Healthy Foundation) also worked well but it's discontinued and I'm on my last bottle. :( And the shade match wasn't great with it either.

Makeup,"Advice/tips for a beginner?/Help with concealer/powder toneHi, 15 year old trying to teach himself makeup here, I've only ever used liquid eyeliner for corpse paint when I was 13 and small pencil eyeliner since last year. I wanna have eyebrows like Daniel Ash from Bauhaus and thought hiding the tails instead of shaving them off would be a safer idea, according to tutorials all the makeup needed besides glue is concealer and powder in your skin tone.

Makeup,"Tinted Lip Balm RecommendationsI'm typically a bold lip person, but since the pandemic and working from home, I'm always reaching for a soothing balm with enough color to pop on my Zoom.

I want a solid ""two-fer"" and I don't want gloss. Something that looks a bit like lipstick, but has all the soothing/cooling properties of a medicated balm.

I've been loving Lip Freak in Nude Attitude, but I can't find it ANYWHERE anymore (used to purchase at Ulta). It really provides a strong cooling effect and the color is actually pretty pigmented.

Makeup,"I'm an absolute beginner. Need tips for how to do just basic makeup.First of all, I'm trans. Kind of a feminine looking guy but still biologically male.

I have zero clue what to do and how to make it look good. The most I've really done is eyeliner and mascara. I just want to do something basic, maybe with a goth-y alt-y tinge to fit in with my style.

My skin tone is quite mixed because of being of mixed races, people have mistook me for Hispanic, it's quite tan. In reality I'm half Caucasian half Pacific Islander.   
My nose is pretty small, my lips are quite full, and my skin is already pretty decent looking.

I think the main problem for me is my eyes and brows. I have zero clue on how to do my brows, just no idea. My eyes are pretty deep-set and I have long eyelashes thankfully. However my right eye is near impossible to see out of- I can only see blurry shapes out of it which makes everything a lot more difficult.

Just suggest to me what I should do to make myself look more feminine with makeup, essentially.

Makeup,"Recommendations for a pretty sheer tinted moisturizer/bb cream/whatever for oily skin?Hello! Bit of a makeup newbie here, just in that I've stuck to very very basic everyday makeup since I was a teenager. I've never regularly used any skin makeup (usually just mascara and brows), but I'm going through a phase of breaking out and just having generally shitty skin recently that I probably won't be able to get solved for at least a few months, and I've been feeling self-conscious going out with my skin like this. 

I've found a medium coverage (I think?) solution for when I want my skin to look nice - like if I'm going out to some event. For those occasions, I use IT cosmetics CC+ cream, finished with Laura Mercier translucent setting powder, which I need lots of because I have quite oily skin. It still gets shinier than I would like late into the day, but it's been working better than anything I've found previously.

However, I kind of just hate wearing it, and wouldn't want to do it on a daily basis (which might just be me not being used to wearing face makeup but UGH how do you deal with not being able to so much as touch your face or it'll come off?? Like I have to rub at my nose every time I take off my sunglasses because they will have left little marks in my foundation. And I can't wipe my mouth with a napkin when I eat. Or eat something messy. Or hug someone wearing dark clothes. Or get sweaty. It just feels so high-maintenance lol) 

I don't really want or need my whole face to look perfect and smooth every day, but I also don't really like going around with my uneven skin tone and fading marks from old acne and obviously the current acne on full display, so I guess I'm searching for an in-between, easier solution. Ideally, I would like something that I could quickly apply across my face to even it out and cover some of those mostly-faded marks, then put something heavier on just the current problem-spots, and it would actually stick to my face and not be a pain in the ass and also not make me look sweaty ten minutes after putting it on. I also need to have SPF protection, so either built in to this or formulated in a way that it'll be okay if I put on my regular SPF moisturizer first? 

All recommendations welcome, as well as technique ideas or any other tips you think I might benefit from because I've never really been able to figure skin makeup out.

Makeup,"False eyelash adhesiveHey all! 
Please forgive any formatting issues, this is my first Reddit post and I'm using my phone.

My 15yr old daughter got me into wearing fake eyelashes recently. She wears them almost daily, I wear them when I'm going out or want to feel pretty. So obviously they can be worn numerous time but I notice the eye lash adhesive builds up and becomes gunky. I asked my daughter how to remove the build up and she said you have to pull it off bit by bit. That doesn't seem right to me and it takes a while. 
So my question is, how do you remove lash adhesive? Is there a specific product?

Makeup,"Applied for Beauty Advisor in Sephora. Pros and Cons of working there?Today I had applied for the role of the Beauty Advisor since I do have some experience with make up and lots of customer service since I’ve had other jobs previously. 

I live in California and I understand the salary and pays by the hour is different by state, but in the application they had asked the question: “what is your desired salary/pay?” And I had gotten used to my pay from previous jobs so I had put “$15”. 

I’ve been researching a lot after finishing and sending my application and I’m kind of scared of them not calling for an interview now because what if my desired pay is too high for them?

Recently I have REALLY wanted to do my makeup all pretty and just feel like the beautiful woman I am on the inside! However, my issue is, I have a very masculine face. 
Ive been watching LOTS of tutorials on YouTube and this is what I gather I need as of product: 
primer, concealer, foundation, blush, maybe some highlighter, mascara, eye shadow, eye lash curler, lip liner, lipstick, and maybe some lipgloss to compliment. I was also thinking I’d need brushes, sponges, nail polish, hair ties, make up wipes, etc..
Now mind you, I have NO idea what I am doing, and have never done any type of makeup before. I mean I get the gist from watching the tutorials. Prime my face where I may have facial hair and any veins, add foundation to my whole face pretty much, some concealer next, blush that I would apply to my cheek bones and next to my eye brows. 
Then I would get to my eyes, applying eye shadow(I’m thinking a cute sparkly pink and purple), add mascara with a cute wing. 
Then to the lips: sketch the outer limits of my lips with the lip liner, apply lipstick(I’m thinking a pink to match my eyes), and then maybe a little lip gloss to compliment. 
Like I said, I have no idea if ANY of what I’ve said is right and could really use a friend for help! Comments, dm, any advice or tips you can offer would be greatly appreciated!!! 💕","['Makeup', 'help', 'please', 'Hello', 'everyone', 'Before', 'start', 'may', 'just', 'say', 'PLEASE', 'EXCUSE', 'MY', 'IGNORANCE', 'OF', 'ALL', 'TYPE', 'HERE', 'year', 'old', 'mtf', 'and', 'am', 'having', 'bit', 'of', 'trouble', 'Recently', 'have', 'REALLY', 'wanted', 'to', 'do', 'my', 'makeup', 'all', 'pretty', 'and', 'just', 'feel', 'like', 'the', 'beautiful', 'woman', 'am', 'on', 'the', 'inside', 'However', 'my', 'issue', 'is', 'have', 'very', 'masculine', 'face', 'Ive', 'been', 'watching', 'LOTS', 'of', 'tutorials', 'on', 'YouTube', 'and', 'this', 'is', 'what', 'gather', 'need', 'as', 'of', 'product', 'primer', 'concealer', 'foundation', 'blush', 'maybe', 'some', 'highlighter', 'mascara', 'eye', 'shadow', 'eye', 'lash', 'curler', 'lip', 'liner', 'lipstick', 'and', 'maybe', 'some', 'lipgloss', 'to', 'compliment', 'was', 'also', 'thinking', 'need', 'brushes', 'sponges', 'nail', 'polish', 'hair', 'ties', 'make', 'up', 'wipes', 'etc', 'Now', 'mind', 'you', 'have', 'NO', 'idea', 'what', 'am', 'doing', 'and', 'have', 'never', 'done', 'any', 'type', 'of', 'makeup', 'before', 'mean', 'get', 'the', 'gist', 'from', 'watching', 'the', 'tutorials', 'Prime', 'my', 'face', 'where', 'may', 'have', 'facial', 'hair', 'and', 'any', 'veins', 'add', 'foundation', 'to', 'my', 'whole', 'face', 'pretty', 'much', 'some', 'concealer', 'next', 'blush', 'that', 'would', 'apply', 'to', 'my', 'cheek', 'bones', 'and', 'next', 'to', 'my', 'eye', 'brows', 'Then', 'would', 'get', 'to', 'my', 'eyes', 'applying', 'eye', 'shadow', 'thinking', 'cute', 'sparkly', 'pink', 'and', 'purple', 'add', 'mascara', 'with', 'cute', 'wing', 'Then', 'to', 'the', 'lips', 'sketch', 'the', 'outer', 'limits', 'of', 'my', 'lips', 'with', 'the', 'lip', 'liner', 'apply', 'lipstick', 'thinking', 'pink', 'to', 'match', 'my', 'eyes', 'and', 'then', 'maybe', 'little', 'lip', 'gloss', 'to', 'compliment', 'Like', 'said', 'have', 'no', 'idea', 'if', 'ANY', 'of', 'what', 've', 'said', 'is', 'right', 'and', 'could', 'really', 'use', 'friend', 'for', 'help', 'Comments', 'dm', 'any', 'advice', 'or', 'tips', 'you', 'can', 'offer', 'would', 'be', 'greatly', 'appreciated']",makeup help please hello everyone before start may just say please excuse my ignorance of all type here year old mtf and am having bit of trouble recently have really wanted to do my makeup all pretty and just feel like the beautiful woman am on the inside however my issue is have very masculine face ive been watching lots of tutorial on youtube and this is what gather need a of product primer concealer foundation blush maybe some highlighter mascara eye shadow eye lash curler lip liner lipstick and maybe some lipgloss to compliment wa also thinking need brush sponge nail polish hair tie make up wipe etc now mind you have no idea what am doing and have never done any type of makeup before mean get the gist from watching the tutorial prime my face where may have facial hair and any vein add foundation to my whole face pretty much some concealer next blush that would apply to my cheek bone and next to my eye brow then would get to my eye applying eye shadow thinking cute sparkly pink and purple add mascara with cute wing then to the lip sketch the outer limit of my lip with the lip liner apply lipstick thinking pink to match my eye and then maybe little lip gloss to compliment like said have no idea if any of what ve said is right and could really use friend for help comments dm any advice or tip you can offer would be greatly appreciated

Makeup,"I’m (22F) going to a wedding next month and know nothing about makeup, help?Hi! As you can tell from the title, I don’t use makeup that often. I usually just go for concealer under my eyes (I use the revolution conceal and define one in the shade C7) and mascara (I use the catrice waterproof one). 

I’m going to my first wedding in may and I wanted to look good. So if you have the time to read through all of this and want to help, I would greatly appreciate input and recommendations! 

Some background: I’m 22, F, I’m from Europe, so I don’t have access to all the products there are in the US. I have dry and sensitive skin, but I’m also allergic to hyaluronic acid and I can’t spend a lot of money on this (max 50€ for the whole look) 

What I need: hydrating primer (without hyaluronic acid), foundation and lipstick

I’ve done some research. The main reasons I don’t use foundation are because I’m afraid of looking orange and because it looks terrible on my forehead. From what I could tell, I can fix this with an hydrating primer and a beauty blender (I already have one). But it gets hard to find an hydrating primer that doesn’t have hyaluronic acid. I saw one by nyx (marshmallow primer), but I don’t know if it is good, I’ve seen mixed reviews. 

For foundation, I was thinking about the fenty skin tint, but I’m afraid because I’ve seen some people saying it clings to dry patches.
I wanted the rare beauty skin tint, but is not available where I live yet and I don’t have enough time to import it. I don’t know if the rare beauty foundation is good? Or maybe another one you might know? I’ve also seen one by catrice called hd liquid coverage, but I don’t know how it works with dry skin.

For my eyes, I’m thinking about just trying to do a small wing in brown and maybe no eyeshadow, since I have hooded lids and you can’t see it anyways.

For lipstick I was thinking the maybelline super stay ink liquid lipstick in shade 5 or 15 ( I haven’t seen it in person yet) 

As you can see, I don’t want nothing really fancy, just a natural makeup look that’s a little more put together than an everyday look. If you have any product recommendations or opinions, I would really appreciate it!","['22F', 'going', 'to', 'wedding', 'next', 'month', 'and', 'know', 'nothing', 'about', 'makeup', 'help', 'Hi', 'As',

Makeup,"I think I know why the glowy makeup look is now a trendI know it sounds obvious, but I think I have a logical explanation as to why the glowy makeup look is now a big trend.

Before Covid, it was all about matte. Matte skin, blinding highlighter, &amp; matte lips. Now, it's about glowy skin, luminous (but not blinding) highlighter, liquid/cream blush, &amp; glossy lips. So what I'm trying to point out here is once we're vaccinated, most places lift mask mandates, &amp; we can enjoy being outdoors again, we want to look &amp; feel like we're born again. We've been stuck at our homes for much longer than we like &amp; we want our makeup to emulate that.

Makeup,"Make-up Changes with AgeOver the sbut down, like most of us, I had an overhaul of my make-up and skincare. I turned 45. I'm still young looking but there has been changes to my skin. I have been working from home on a permanent basis for 3 years and as such my skin has gotten paler. I have also become more sallow (yellow- toned).  I was a colour analyst for a 4 years and my focus was on finding the perfect shades and textures. For refence I'm Bright Winter (Rosy under tone with icy yellow surface tone) with dark hair and green-grey eyes. Extremely pale. 

Age-related changes:

\- Sallow skin and more hyperpigmentation 

\- Thinner skin under my eyes- blue veins showing

\- Loss of facial volume (deeper naso-labial folds, hollow under eyes and deeper set eyes)

\- Thinner hair, especially around hairline

\- Drier skin overall

\- Thinner lips 

&amp;#x200B;

Changes I made:

\- Threw out all yellow/ gold/ peachy -toned highters, foundations, concealers &amp; powders

\- I kept only my white and white-pink highlighters &amp; bought a clear face gloss too

\- Use 2 primers- a glowy white one  to mimic juicy skin and a lilac one to counteract the yellow tones

\- Use a bright orange colour corrector on the veins under my eyes 

\- Bought a paler foundation (EL double-wear in Alabaster) and setting/finishing powder 

\- Switched to cream blush and shader (can layer powder on top for longevity) 

\- Switched to tubing mascara as it tend stop smudge and smear these days, even waterproof . Also tried a lash primer and it really works to enhance the lashes. I have never been able to do falsies.

\- Changed placement of blush to under eyes and more towards the nose to lift the face

\- Changed placement of eyeshadow - higher on the brow bone and not so in the socket- focus on elongating the eye (rather than enhancing the round, deep shape)

\- Found sheer lipstick/ tinted balm in my favourite shades to use in the day time (get lots of compliments on these)- makes my lips look fuller. (I do over-line sometimes)

\- Shortened my brows to lift my eyes 

\- Bought some new brushes and tools- foundation diffuser brush and concealer diffuser brush for final polishing 

\- Vastly reduced my eyeshadow collection to just those that flatter my eyes tone-plums mostly

\- I use a root touch up powder (the powder cake type with a brush) to fill in my temples and hair line- can also use it as brow powder. (also started dying my hair as the greys were getting noticeable)

I must have gifted or thrown away about £500 worth of make-up and am in the process of replacing with just the products that will work for me. Like a lot of people I got sucked into over-consuming and hoarding and I also collected products for all the season types for my colour analysis business. I am no longer doing this so I don't need all of it. 

I also overhauled my skincare and body care products - but that's for another post or sub.  This was all part of  project of Decluttering myself/ my fantasy self- which is a fascinating subject in itself.","['Make', 'up', 'Changes', 'with', 'AgeOver', 'the', 'sbut', 'down', 'like', 'most',

Makeup,"Has your attitude towards makeup change as you gotten older?Back in the day, I was watching Allison (formally known as Amarixe on Youtube) &amp; I love her videos. I always admired her makeup. 7 or 6 years ago, she started a journey towards minimalism &amp; during that time &amp; once she got married, I can see that her attitude towards makeup has started to change.

I have nothing against it &amp; she seems happy now than ever. For me now, I like putting on &amp; wearing makeup because it makes me feels good. It's just for me &amp; as long as I acknowledge &amp; love myself without it, I'm gonna keep on doing it for a long as I can.

Makeup,"Skin pilling during morning skincare routine SOSHey, guys! So I’ve been having a lot of issues with skin pilling during skincare and makeup routine. I thought it might be an incompatibility between my primer and foundation, but they are both silicone based. So I figured it might boil down to skin prep. I bought the Dr. Dennis gross exfoliating pads, and was told to do that before I applied makeup. So I did that today, put on my vitamin C serum, and skin fx peptide cream. Things were going great until i started putting on my supergoop glow screen and the pilling started again.

Makeup,"Make up times and advice for interns and entry-level peeps?I’m in my early-mid 20s and about to start working at a tech company this summer. It’s my first time working in a fancy-ish office building… or working period. I’m super nervous about what to wear and how to do my make up. 

I hate getting up early but it takes me usually 25-35 mins on avg to do my skincare and make up. 
Is that too long? How can I shorten it? I was wondering how long you guys take to get ready?  What’s your basic go to work look routine look like? What are some of you’re go to touchup or quick application products?

Also I’m worried about wearing “too much” make up or too little. I hate that this is a thing but I’ve seen many posts saying that people are treated better when they wear makeup and overlooked when they don’t. But i’ve also seen posts saying that they were dismissed for being a “pretty face” bc they did wear make up. I know its a lose-lose situation. The field i’m entering is verrrrry male dominant and i want to be taken seriously, make friends, and climb the ranks… but I also want to look and feel good while doing it. Thoughts on this?

My friend told me just to do: skincare, concealer or skintint, natural lips color, and maybe some eyeliner.

Makeup,"Most makeup products makes my eyes tear upAs the title says, this is a bummer because I love putting eyeshadows and everything like that. Powder makeup and most of it if something falls into my eye I start to tear up and have to wash everything off. And still my eyes don't recover until next day. I put some eye drops for moisturizing and doesn't work.
So I have been limiting myself on putting some Cetaphil moisturizing cream and some corrector on my red areas or pimples. Some blush from creamy texture sticks, eyeliner, and mascara called paradise something from L'Oreal I think. 
Who would you guys advise me to see? Is this a medical condition? Some allergies to dome components?

Makeup,"Which brand for wedding makeup?I'm doing my own makeup for my wedding. The plan is to go to the local fancy department store counters, ask for a demo to get some help with techniques, and buy the recommended products.  I have red hair, blonde eyelashes, and very fair skin, so getting the right products can be tricky. My ideal look is minimal with a subtle eye and a pop of colour on the lips. 

The trouble is that I have no idea which brand is the best, as I haven't worn much makeup for the last few years. 

The choices are: 

* Charlotte Tilbury 
* MAC
* Chanel 
* Estee Lauder
* NARS
* Lancome

Makeup,"Why don't cosmetic companies want to work with older women?As I get older, my skin changes and my makeup needs to change.  I find it extremely expensive buying full-size bottles of makeup that are labeled for my age group only to use them once because they don't work with my skin type or cause allergic reactions.

I've tried to use a damp sponge but it just takes away what I have applied. But as a result of using the sponge dry it isn't the smoothest finish

I wash my face twice a day with La Roche Posay Effaclar facewash, then I apply The Ordinary Hyaluronic Acid, for the day I use Altruist Face Fluid 50SPF and for the night I use Altruist Moisturising Fluid. I also use eye cream every day and The Ordinary Niacinamide 3-4 times a week.

I spent an impressive amount of money trying other drug store foundations, but they all were total fails. My latest disappointment is Purito Cica Clearing BB cream. It's so praised, I had to try it.

Essence brow gel- same as wow brow, no hold and kinda messy

Makeup,"Palette Review &amp; Pictorial - KimChi Chic Beauty: Virgin Mojito[Pictures are available on my profile, if you are interested!] 

✅  Saturday Palette Review &amp; Pictorial 🤓 

...... 

➡️ NOTE: the information contained within this post is based upon my research, opinions, and experience. As always, buy/use the products that make YOU happy. Also, none of my stuff is sponsored. I do it for fun. 

...... 

🔺️ PALETTE: KimChi Chic Beauty - Virgin Mojito Palette✌ 

...... 

🔺️ ACQUIRED: purchased myself 

...... 

👁 LOOK CREATED: 'switching shades' 

...... 

▪️ PACKAGING &amp; DESIGN: each pan holds 0.8g of product, circular-shaped pans, very plain cardboard packaging, bi-fold, palette name &amp; brand is on cover, light-weight, magnetic closure system, small square shape, no mirror inside, tried a heavy magnet &amp; pans are NOT removable, shade nomenclature is designated first in English (to the northwest of each shade) and again in French (mainly to the southeast of each shade) 


🔊 NOTICE: 

+ At 0.8g, each shadow weighs significantly BELOW the average amount per pan. I don't think anybody would find difficulty in storing this palette. 

...... 

▪️ COUNTRY OF ORIGIN: China 

...... 

▪️ TOTAL # OF SHADES: 9 (mixture of eyeshadows &amp; pressed pigments; pressed pigments are not 'eye safe' according to FDA law). Upon more evaluation, several of these pigments DID stain my skin. 

...... 

▪️ TYPES OF FORMULAS: 3 formulas (4 mattes, 3 shimmers, 2 glitters) 

...... 

▪️ DESIGNATION: monochromatic green 

...... 

▪️ DEXTERITY CONCERNS: none 

...... 

▪️ DESCRIPTION OF SHADE PRESS: very soft; recommend doing eyes before base with this palette. 

...... 

▪️ EXTRA PERTINENT INFORMATION: the inspiration behind this palette is the vibrant hues of an ice-cold mojito beverage 

...... 

✅ ROUTINE DATA CHECK: 

+ clean formula 

+ cruelty-free 

+ vegan (PETA-certified) 

+ 12-M PAO (located on back of palette) 

...... 

🔍 COST EVALUATION: (KimChi Chic Beauty) 

💲 $14.00 / palette 

💲 $1.56 / shade 

💲 $1.94 / gram 

...... 

♦️ PRICE PER SHADE SCALE: 

&lt;$2=excellent; $3-$4=affordable; $5-$8=meh; $9-$15=expensive; &gt;$16=very expensive 


• Comparing this palette to similar products available on the market, the price-per-shade is 'excellent'. Additionally - this palette has an average cost-per-gram, as compared to other palettes I've previously reviewed. 

......


🔎 REVIEW: 


🔸️PATCHINESS: no patchiness 


🔸️BLENDABILITY: easy to blend out 


🔸️KICK-BACK/FALL-OUT: 


+ experienced a high-level of kick-back in all shades 


+ experienced fall-out from most shades used, the most fall-out being from glitter shade 'Yellow Diamond' 


🔸️COLOR-STORY CRITIQUE: 


+ this palette inholds the nice 'light-to-dark' gradient that I always look for. The included shades range from light to midtone to deep. There is only one matte option available to insert depth in your look, which drastically limit a palette's versatility (i.e., the types/amount of varying looks you can create). 


+ there are no traditional neutral 'transition shades' included in this particular color-story. 


+ the formula balance ratio in this palette is 4:5 (mattes to non-mattes), &amp; I think a 44% / 56% formula split is fairly balanced, &amp; provides enough range-of-use. I prefer either fairly balanced layouts, OR matte-heavy spreads. 


+ I classify this as a monochromatic green palette, &amp; I don't own another palette like this in my collection. I think this is quite the unique color-story choice. 


+ there is NOT a matte black in this palette, which I always prefer - as it deems any palette truly 'universal'. 


+ there were no 'dud' shades in this palette. 


+ there is no decorative embossing on any of the included shades 

...... 

🔸️FORMULA EVALUATION: 

// 

+ | MATTES |: 

• each one is soft, and each maintains the same consistency across the palette 

• the formula is quite heavy and thick 

• they worked well in creating a gradient 

• I found it easy to layer them 

• each shade applied the exact same tone/color that they appear as in their pan. 

• the matte color selections work well together, it's easy to formulate a look 

• this is a more 'directly pigmented' formula (in lieu of being 'buildable'), making it more difficult to manage and control the formula 

// 

+ | SHIMMERS |: 

• these shimmers are all very smooth in texture, and quite thick 

• each one of the shimmers is highly reflective 

• each shimmer has an intense base pigment, allowing them to be multifunctional 

• these do not require a lot of building; one layer suffices 

• works perfectly well with your finger, a dry brush, or even with a dampened brush. I didn't notice any significant differences between application type 

// 

+ | PRESSED GLITTERS |: 

• these glitters are self-adhesive, not requiring a sticky base for full functionality 

• has an intense base pigment, so they are not sheer shades 

• has quite a heavily-siliconed base, providing for very easy application 

• glitter particles are very small 

• works fine with direct finger application, works BEST with a dampened brush. This formula does not work well paired with a dry brush. 

• although performing the best when used with a dampened brush, the liquid causes a formula reaction, making it apply 'clumpy' with bits adhering to themselves. Using liquid with these makes them POP, but it's a tough road to navigate. 

...... 

🔸️PACKAGING: 


+ the design of this palette is honestly pretty boring on the exterior. Once you open it up, it gets much more fun and animated. The exterior cover is NOT indicative of the shades that you would find inside. 


+ I don't really think that this (in my opinion) 'cheap-looking' packaging is a great representation of the brand (KimChi Chic Beauty), as the brand portrays much more exuviance in nature than the styling of this product would lead you to believe. 

...... 

🔸️COMMENTARY: You are going to have to COMPLETELY forgive me for this poor excuse of an eyeshadow look. I was having such a BAD makeup day today, and although I love these shades and the performance of this palette - I couldn't form a great look today. I will totally stand-by and say that I DID put all of my effort and energy into it, but it just wasn't happening for me today. On a good note, I'm excited to have this palette in my collection, so when I'm feeling the 'creative-bug', I can come up with something really neat by using this unique selection of eyeshadows. If you are into these tones, I don't think you'd be disappointed - even if you aren't typically a fan of glitters, these ones are really spectacular and one-of-a-kind. 

...... 

▪️FINAL RECOMMENDATION: (recommend) 

+ easy formula to work with 

+ unique color-story 

+ exceptional, extraordinaire glitters 

...... 

+ Favorite Shade: Kiwi 

- Least Favorite Shade: Teal Dream 

...... 

🚦 RATING: A 

...... 

⭐ RATING LEGEND: 

A = totally wow'd me 

B = not the best, but I like it 

C = personal bias, nothing wrong w/ product 

D = this didn't work out for me 

F = I totally hate this

no patchiness blendability easy to blend out kick back fall out experienced high level of kick back in all shade experienced fall out from most shade used the most fall out being from glitter shade yellow diamond color story critique this palette inholds the nice light to dark gradient that always look for the included shade range from light to midtone to deep there is only one matte option available to insert depth in your look which drastically limit palette versatility the type amount of varying look you can create there are no traditional neutral transition shade included in this particular color story the formula balance ratio in this palette is matte to non matte amp think formula split is fairly balanced amp provides enough range of use prefer either fairly balanced layout or matte heavy spread classify this a monochromatic green palette amp don own another palette like this in my collection think this is quite the unique color story choice there is not matte black in this palette which always prefer a it deems any palette truly universal there were no dud shade in this palette there is no decorative embossing on any of the included shade formula evaluation mattes each one is soft and each maintains the same consistency across the palette the formula is quite heavy and thick they worked well in creating gradient found it easy to layer them each shade applied the exact same tone color that they appear a in their pan the matte color selection work well together it easy to formulate look this is more directly pigmented formula in lieu of being buildable making it more difficult to manage and control the formula shimmers these shimmer are all very smooth in texture and quite thick each one of the shimmer is highly reflective each shimmer ha an intense

Makeup,"Talcum powder in Makeup being super toxic? Does anyone here actually know if it will affect you THAT badly?My mother has recently became super paranoid on the health impacts of talcum powder (all talc contains asbestos)

Makeup,"Can’t figure out what’s going wrong with my makeup?i’ve recently been having a lot of issues with my makeup not wearing well at all, no matter what product. estée lauder dw, nars creamy concealer, tarte shape tape, etc etc. /none/ of my makeup wears well.

i’ve tried different moisturizers - eucerin urea, soon jung 2x barrier, soon jung hydro barrier, kiehls, dr jart ceramidin, to name a few. 

i’m thinking the culprit may be my sunscreen? but i’ve tried a couple and all have the same issue. canmake mermaid, make prem uv defence me. tried la roche posay fluide recently and even that has the same problem

I thought I was matching the bases decently, at least trying not to put silicone based under water based. all the foundations i’ve tried afaik have been silicone based.

I’m worried it’s just the sunscreen and from applying the recommended amount. 
it separates and looks powdery &amp; oily somehow after a couple hours, and even immediately after setting it’s almost like the powder just looks powdery and not blurring/setting. i’m using hourglass’s powder currently, so unless it’s the powder…

any ideas? am I mixing the wrong bases? i’ve tried mixing squalane oil into moisturizer as well. doesn’t help.. &amp; i do wait until my moisturizer etc is set or as set as it will be between layers

Makeup,"LF ysl rouge volupte shine dupeHi! I’ve been watching videos after videos on YouTube trying to search for a lip product with a similar formula to the the ysl volupte shine. It’s my favourite lipstick and ever since I discovered it it’s the only makeup product I wear on a day to day basis. I love the way it’s feels (oil/serum like rather than a thick balm) and how the colour is not as opaque as a lipstick but more pigmented than the typical tinted lip balm.

I’ve gone cruelty free so I have to find an alternative but with so many products on the market I’m a bit overwhelmed and would really appreciate any help. I also am really casual when it comes to makeup so I don’t keep up with all the new releases so yea.. there’s a lot of products to sift through in the sheer lipstick/tinted balm department.

Makeup,"Makeup pillingHeyy everyone! I am new to makeup so I ask ya'll to help me out 😭. 
/I have normal to dry skin/
So, my makeup keeps pilling everytime I put my foundation on. (I make sure to wait in between before applying my products).The pilling happens even if I exfoliate my skin :(

My makeup in order is, wash face ~&gt; toner (tonymoly mocchi toner) ~&gt; moisturizer (hada labo hydrating milk) ~&gt; primer (Too Faced hangover primer) ~&gt; i mix two foundations to make it close to my skin tone which are Giorgio Armani Luminous Silk foundation + Yves Rocher Zero Defaut foundation. I apply my foundation with a little bit wet beauty blender. 

Any idea on where I went wrong and how I can fix this issue? Should I replace any products? Please recommend your holy grail normal to dry skin products to me :)

Makeup,"New to makeup, feeling totally overwhelmed!Hi everyone.


I am a 31F who has very little experience with makeup.  I am currently working on a degree that should get me in a career within the next few years. I really want to be somewhat good at using makeup by then so I want to start now.  I think the makeup look is more professional and would fit the capsule wardrobe I'm working on better than a plain face.  Plus, it looks fun and I want that creative outlet in my life SO BAD.  


Anyway, I'm looking for super beginner friendly brands and tips to get me started.  I'm not even sure what all I need to buy and everytime I watch a tutorial there's a new product I've never heard of.  So my questions are:


What products and equipment does a new user need?  I only own one mascara, one blush, and one lipstick. 



I want to learn how to contour. Is that too advanced for a beginner?  If not what products are needed for that?  



Also, I would love brand recommendations that are skin and budget friendly.

Makeup,"Fenty Beauty Eaze Drop Blurring Skin Tint or Pro Filt'r Soft Matte Longwear FoundationHello guys! I'd like some help. I've been wanting to get a new foundation/skin tint and I've been thinking of either the Fenty Beauty Skin Tint or the Matte Foundation. 

My skin is oily/combi + with a little hormonal acne + some hyperpigmentation. I've veins that are quite obvious on my face and I am on the fairer side, Asian. I've been using Catrice True Skin Hydrating Foundation and it's so good but I'm thinking of changing it up. 

Been eyeing the Rare Beauty skin tint but realizes that the coverage isn't that good as compared to the Fenty Beauty. I'm not looking for complete full coverage, but more of a better/presentable finish and not a cakey finish. 

Also, was wondering if I get the skin tint from Fenty, can I also double it up as a concealer over my Catrice foundation?","['Fenty', 'Beauty', 'Eaze', 'Drop', 'Blurring', 'Skin', 'Tint', 'or', 'Pro', 'Filt', 'Soft', 'Matte', 'Longwear', 'FoundationHello', 'guys', 'like', 'some', 'help', 've', 'been', 'wanting', 'to', 'get', 'new', 'foundation', 'skin', 'tint', 'and', 've', 'been', 'thinking', 'of', 'either', 'the', 'Fenty', 'Beauty', 'Skin', 'Tint', 'or', 'the', 'Matte', 'Foundation', 'My', 'skin', 'is', 'oily', 'combi', 'with', 'little', 'hormonal', 'acne', 'some', 'hyperpigmentation', 've', 'veins', 'that', 'are', 'quite', 'obvious', 'on', 'my', 'face', 'and', 'am', 'on', 'the', 'fairer', 'side', 'Asian', 've', 'been', 'using', 'Catrice', 'True', 'Skin', 'Hydrating', 'Foundation', 'and', 'it', 'so', 'good', 'but', 'thinking', 'of', 'changing', 'it', 'up', 'Been', 'eyeing', 'the', 'Rare', 'Beauty', 'skin', 'tint', 'but', 'realizes', 'that', 'the', 'coverage', 'isn', 'that', 'good', 'as', 'compared', 'to', 'the', 'Fenty', 'Beauty', 'not', 'looking', 'for', 'complete', 'full', 'coverage', 'but', 'more', 'of', 'better', 'presentable', 'finish', 'and', 'not', 'cakey', 'finish', 'Also', 'was', 'wondering', 'if', 'get', 'the', 'skin', 'tint', 'from', 'Fenty', 'can', 'also', 'double', 'it', 'up', 'as', 'concealer', 'over', 'my', 'Catrice', 'foundation']",fenty beauty eaze drop blurring skin tint or pro filt soft matte longwear foundationhello guy like some help ve been wanting to get new foundation skin tint and ve been thinking of either the fenty beauty skin tint or the matte foundation my skin is oily combi with little hormonal acne some hyperpigmentation ve vein that are quite obvious on my face and am on the fairer side asian ve been using catrice true skin hydrating foundation and it so good but thinking of changing it up been eyeing the rare beauty skin tint but realizes that the coverage isn that good a compared to the fenty beauty not looking for complete full coverage but more of better presentable finish and not cakey finish also wa wondering if get the skin tint from fenty can also double it up a concealer over my catrice foundation

Makeup,"Am I just stupid, or I should throw away this foundation?So I was doing a ""Makeup-workshop"" thing round about March. And there the woman used the Lancome Teint idole ultra wear foundation in the shade 021. In the Douglas shop at my town just was the shade 2. I bought it, but it felt red toned. If I asked anyone they said no, but I felt it. So I ordered the L. A. Girl foundation mixing pigment in the shed yellow, what removed the yellowish shade, but I just find that like this it is too dark. Should I order a white pigment also, or just simply go for the ""right shade""?
It is pretty hard for me to find the right foundation, because I want to match my head with my neck, and my face a bit more ""pinkish"" somewhere, so my skintone just uneven. And if I like this choose a foundation the color of my head don't fits to my neck's. I'm autumn type, so a creolish skin color with yellowish undertone, and pale.

Makeup,"Face looks red/pink under foundationHi all,  
I was checking out my face makeup in my car mirror yesterday, and I noticed that my face looks pretty pinkish with my makeup, compared to my neck which is pretty pale.

I honestly don't know if I'm warm toned or cooled toned and no matter how much someone explains it, I still have no idea. I do have acne prone with with scarring/pigmentation, so my skin tone is pretty uneven and more on the pink/red side sometimes.

One of my brother's is secretly suffering with his mental health and nedeed company yesterday 24/7 and I found a doctor to see him tomorrow and a clinic in case he needs to be admitted for evaluation and sympathy. I could not bear to lose a brother, much less that way, as he has saved me twice from taking my own life. 

My work is intense. I mentioned I was in a car accident and needed x-rays and therefore would need the day. They want more info. Not documentation, but I know they'll look for that seatbelt burn along my neck and the airbag burn on my chest. 

I have a ton of makeup, but am looking for any advice on how to enhance these bruised areas, add setting spray, and keep it believable?

Any pro makeup aficionado tips or tricks?

Makeup,"Recommendation: primer to use with Bare Minerals Tinted Moisturizer?Hello all,

I'm looking for a primer to wear under my Bare Minerals Tinted Moisturizer or alone. I don't wear makeup regularly; probably only put it on 1-2x a month depending. I'm actually not even sure I can wear a primer underneath a tinted moisturizer?

I have fairly normal skin, tending towards dryness and redness at times. Something moisturizing would be good as I'm in a desert environment. SPF would be good!

Makeup,"High coverage drugstore concealer good for dark circlesHi! I don't have much experience with different brands of concealers so I thought that I'd ask people on this sub for some advice. 

I have pretty dark circles under my eyes, always had them and they're not affected by how much I sleep so I'm pretty sure they're just genetic in my case. 

What are some affordable good concealers that I'd be able to find at a drugstore? For reference I live in Ireland so if there's any UK or Irish specific brands that you guys know of that are reliable and good I'd appreciate the recommendations.

🏅CURRENT RATINGS ASSESSMENT: 

+ Sephora: 4.3 / 5.0 (1,450 ratings)

+ Kohl's: 4.4 / 5.0 (835 ratings)

+ Makeup Forever: 4.5 / 5.0 (1,496 ratings)

+ Google: 4.3 / 5.0 (1,700 ratings)

+ Nordstrom: 4.5 / 5.0 (1,404 ratings)

.............................

TOTAL AVERAGE RATING: 4.4 / 5.0 

......

⭐ INITIAL APPLICATION: (1200) thicker consistency, preferred brush application (needed less product for better coverage), high-medium coverage application, covered all of my redness, melasma, &amp; blemishes - but could still see through to some of my darker scarring &amp; blemishes, natural skin finish

......

🕑 2-HOUR MARK: (1400) still wearable; still completely full-coverage. Still looks same as application. Kind of settling into my fine lines, but nothing terrible. My face is sweating, and it's completely repelling the sweat and not being affected by it. 

......

🕔 5-HOUR MARK: (1700) still wearable; both sides look perfectly in place. Even the wear lines from earlier have kind of settled and are no longer apparent. I'm noticeably more shiny than last check-in. There is a small area on the sponge-side next to my nose that looks a little funky, so I'm going to keep my eye on it. 

......

🕗 8-HOUR MARK: (2000) still wearable; still looks the same as application, nothing has budged. I could really use a touch-up powder, as the foundation still pretty shiny on my t-zone area. A little wear is showing around the left corner of my mouth, but it's barely noticeable.

......

🕛 12-HOUR MARK: (0000) still wearable (w/ touch-up); only change is some more shine. Everything is still perfectly in place! 

......

🤓 OVERALL REVIEW: 

//

+ TRUE COVERAGE: high-medium, buildable

•

+ TRUE FINISH: natural satin, self-setting, becomes dewy overtime 

•

+ OXIDIZATION: yes; slight oxidization - but not enough to worry about switching shades

•

+ MELASMA TEST: passed; covered up all of my melasma patches

•

+ PACKAGING: very cute, love the upgraded bottle, the cream-shade cover is a nice luxurious touch that sets it apart from other foundations 

•

+ RESULTS TO CLAIMS: medium to full coverage = yes, blurs and covers imperfections for 24-hours = yes, flexes with skin for no caking or settling into lines = yes, waterproof and sweat-proof = yes, semi-matte yet luminous finish = yes

•

+ VALUE: Using the 'average' amount of foundation as 1.0 fl oz., this particular bottle contains 1.01 fl oz. This calculates to be $42.58/ounce, which I would consider high-end pricing

♦️ PRICE PER 1.00 FL OZ SCALE:
&lt;$10=low-end; $11-$25=mid-end;  $26-$60= high-end; &gt;$61=luxury

•

+ RECOMMENDATION: yes; I think this foundation works quite well after all I put it through today. I was impressed with the no-budge staying power, and how perfectly it repelled sweat. I noticed it settling into fine lines, and when I looked again, it completely fixed and refreshed itself. It's also a self-setting formula, meaning you don't have to layer a setting powder over it for it to last! I'm going to continue wearing and loving this! 

//

RECOMMENDED APPLICATION TYPE: brush

RECOMMENDED MAX WEAR TIME: 12+ hrs

RECOMMENDED SKIN TYPE: dry, combo, normal

Makeup,"Men's makeup products are poorI am a man. I do use a tinted moisturizer from time to time if I want to disguise redness and spots. Nothing special and unnoticeable. It was mainly to help with social anxiety and confidence. I have problems with my image

I started out 6 months ago with a men's brand. Their tinted moisturizer gave a good colour (though orangey) but didn't disguise or hide spots or redness, it cost about £22.

I bought Loreal Skin Paradise Tinted Water Cream for £9.99 and it did a way better job. Except this time it hides imperfections more and looks exactly like my skin. So even better

Makeup,"My Damn Oily Eyelids!!Hi if anyone could give me some advice I’d be so grateful. Last year I ended up going to get Permanent Makeup done, just the simple permanent eyeliner. But my eyelids are so oily it didn’t take! Literally 3-4 days after it naturally scabbed (like it was supposed to) then.. nothing! The permanent eyeliner ink was gone!! 

I called the technician and explained what happened and she said “Well you do have VERY oily lids.”  So I technically wasted $350. for nothing! 
I’m reaching out to see if anyone has any options. Should I try it one last time? Will that new upper eyelash enhancement work? Or do I just forget about ever wanting the glorious look of eyeliner? Do you have oily eyelids AND Permanent Eyeliner?

Makeup,"Beginning Makeup!Hello, everyone! I'm just starting getting into makeup, but I've had a lot of trouble. 

My first ever time buying makeup was about a year ago when I went to Walmart and splurged about $200 on all of the essentials (a few eyeshadow palettes, eyeliner, foundation, blush, etc.) and was super excited to try it out.

I've only been able to put on any makeup about 3 times, though, because I have a serious reaction to it. My eyes turn red, burn, and begin to water and my nose starts to run. The skin around my eyes also gets really puffy. I don't have any rashes or other serious symptoms of allergies, but I'm wondering if my reaction to this makeup would apply to ALL (or most) makeup types or just the specific brands I bought. Is this a common issue? I also haven't figured out specifically what makeup item I have that causes a reaction. 

I also would like to have some help figuring out my eye and face shape and learning what kinds of makeup looks would work for me. I don't have a mom or any sisters to show me how to do this, so I'm figuring it all out by myself. Any comments, DMs or links to helpful info would be much appreciated! 💗","['Beginning', 'Makeup', 'Hello', 'everyone', 'just', 'starting', 'getting', 'into', 'makeup', 'but', 've', 'had', 'lot', 'of', 'trouble', 'My', 'first', 'ever', 'time', 'buying', 'makeup', 'was', 'about', 'year', 'ago', 'when', 'went', 'to', 'Walmart', 'and', 'splurged', 'about', 'on', 'all', 'of', 'the', 'essentials', 'few', 'eyeshadow', 'palettes', 'eyeliner', 'foundation', 'blush', 'etc', 'and', 'was', 'super', 'excited', 'to', 'try', 'it', 'out', 've', 'only', 'been', 'able', 'to', 'put', 'on', 'any', 'makeup', 'about', 'times', 'though', 'because', 'have', 'serious', 'reaction', 'to', 'it', 'My', 'eyes', 'turn', 'red', 'burn', 'and', 'begin', 'to', 'water', 'and', 'my', 'nose', 'starts', 'to', 'run', 'The', 'skin', 'around', 'my', 'eyes', 'also', 'gets', 'really', 'puffy', 'don', 'have', 'any', 'rashes', 'or', 'other', 'serious', 'symptoms', 'of', 'allergies', 'but', 'wondering', 'if', 'my', 'reaction', 'to', 'this', 'makeup', 'would', 'apply', 'to', 'ALL', 'or', 'most', 'makeup', 'types', 'or', 'just', 'the', 'specific', 'brands', 'bought', 'Is', 'this', 'common', 'issue', 'also', 'haven', 'figured', 'out', 'specifically', 'what', 'makeup', 'item', 'have', 'that', 'causes', 'reaction', 'also', 'would', 'like', 'to', 'have', 'some', 'help', 'figuring', 'out', 'my', 'eye', 'and', 'face', 'shape', 'and', 'learning', 'what', 'kinds', 'of', 'makeup', 'looks', 'would', 'work', 'for', 'me', 'don', 'have', 'mom', 'or', 'any', 'sisters', 'to', 'show', 'me', 'how', 'to', 'do', 'this', 'so', 'figuring', 'it', 'all', 'out', 'by', 'myself', 'Any', 'comments', 'DMs', 'or', 'links', 'to', 'helpful', 'info', 'would', 'be', 'much', 'appreciated']",beginning makeup hello everyone just starting getting into makeup but ve had lot of trouble my first ever time buying makeup wa about year ago when went to walmart and splurged about on all of the essential few eyeshadow palette eyeliner foundation blush etc and wa super excited to try it out ve only been able to put on any makeup about time though because have serious reaction to it my eye turn red burn and begin to water and my nose start to run the skin around my eye also get really puffy don have any rash or other serious symptom of allergy but wondering if my reaction to this makeup would apply to all or most makeup type or just the specific brand bought is this common issue also haven figured out specifically what makeup item have that cause reaction also would like to have some help figuring out my eye and face shape and learning what kind of makeup look would work for me don have mom or any sister to show me how to do this so figuring it all out by myself any comment dms or link to helpful info would be much appreciated

Makeup,"Private labelling and originalsHi! I am not that big into makeup as a whole, I just adore fun eyeshadows and too much eyeliner as the experimental teenager that I am, but I found the concept of private labelling very interesting, ESPECIALLY in makeup.

As a student and a daughter of smb who works a job that makes products for people, am tired of some of the ""brand"" markups. Drugstore makeup is sufficient, but eyeshadow bugs me a lot, as the most fun colors are hard to come by and don't even get me started on colorful eyeliner (that's a whole category on its own).

Makeup,"My foundation/concealer burns my face?I was using Fenty Beauty Pro Filter but noticed after a few hours my face would start to have this slight burn/itchy feeling.

I have some hyperpigmentation on my cheeks, so I only use NYX Can’t Stop Won’t Stop Concealer but after a few hours that also starts to sting a little.

Makeup,"Rare Beauty Foundation with powder products.Hello everyone! I have the rare beauty foundation since its first launched internationally in July and I really like it. I ordered the blush and a highlighter soon after. Now I don't know if the foundation isn't simply compatible with powder products but everytime when I use a powder highlighter I can't seem to blend it in. It's like a streak on my cheek bone and it doesn't look good. There's the possibility that specifically my powder highlighter just doesn't work on this foundation. I might add that I haven't tried a different highlighter. Sadly I don't have time to do my make up just for fun and to try things out.
I actually wanted to post on the rare beauty sub, but I'm not allowed to. So this is the best sub to ask if anyone had similar experiences with the foundation and powder highlighter and/or if you have any tips.","['Rare', 'Beauty', 'Foundation', 'with', 'powder', 'products', 'Hello', 'everyone', 'have', 'the', 'rare', 'beauty', 'foundation', 'since', 'its', 'first', 'launched', 'internationally', 'in', 'July', 'and', 'really', 'like', 'it', 'ordered', 'the', 'blush', 'and', 'highlighter', 'soon', 'after', 'Now', 'don', 'know', 'if', 'the', 'foundation', 'isn', 'simply', 'compatible', 'with', 'powder', 'products', 'but', 'everytime', 'when', 'use', 'powder', 'highlighter', 'can', 'seem', 'to', 'blend', 'it', 'in', 'It', 'like', 'streak', 'on', 'my', 'cheek', 'bone', 'and', 'it', 'doesn', 'look', 'good', 'There', 'the', 'possibility', 'that', 'specifically', 'my', 'powder', 'highlighter', 'just', 'doesn', 'work', 'on', 'this', 'foundation', 'might', 'add', 'that', 'haven', 'tried', 'different', 'highlighter', 'Sadly', 'don', 'have', 'time', 'to', 'do', 'my', 'make', 'up', 'just', 'for', 'fun', 'and', 'to', 'try', 'things', 'out', 'actually', 'wanted', 'to', 'post', 'on', 'the', 'rare', 'beauty', 'sub', 'but', 'not', 'allowed', 'to', 'So', 'this', 'is', 'the', 'best', 'sub', 'to', 'ask', 'if', 'anyone', 'had', 'similar', 'experiences', 'with', 'the', 'foundation', 'and', 'powder', 'highlighter', 'and', 'or', 'if', 'you', 'have', 'any', 'tips']",rare beauty foundation with powder product hello everyone have the rare beauty foundation since it first launched internationally in july and really like it ordered the blush and highlighter soon after now don know if the foundation isn simply compatible with powder product but everytime when use powder highlighter can seem to blend it in it like streak on my cheek bone and it doesn look good there the possibility that specifically my powder highlighter just doesn work on this foundation might add that haven tried different highlighter sadly don have time to do my make up just for fun and to try thing out actually wanted to post on the rare beauty sub but not allowed to so this is the best sub to ask if anyone had similar experience with the foundation and powder highlighter and or if you have any tip

Makeup,"What is missing from this full full face, like complete, makeup routine?So  I (by accident/ignorance) committed to learning how to apply a truly  comprehensive makeup routine. A super nice and awesome redditor already  gave me a great list of all the different kinds of products involved, so  now I want to do my best to honor that effort and have build a  spreadsheet to research and formulate a routine to work towards.

But  because I am very much a beginner, I am sure I probably forgot  something essential and I want to make sure that I cover everything  before budgeting . So here is the draft for the routine with each  category ordered by what to apply first:

BASE:  Primer, Spot Concealer/Color Corrector/Undereye Concealer,  Liquid Foundation ,  Concealer , Dry Foundation, Setting  Spray, Finishing Spray

EYES:  Eyeshadow Primer, Eyeshadow (as complicated as I can manage),  Liquid Eyeliner, Eyebrow Gel, Fake Lashes, Mascara Primer, Mascara

CHEEKS:  Contour, Bronzer, Blush, Highlighter

LIPS: Lip Primer, Lip Liner, Lipstick, Lipgloss

So  what is missing/ is there someting missing from this routine? Should  moisturizing be part of it? I would really appreciate some feedback. :)

Bonus  question: Would you consider nails to be part of makeup? It does not  seem to get discussed here, so I'm kinda hoping I can weasel out of that  part without feeling like I went back on what I said I would do :D","['What', 'is', 'missing', 'from', 'this', 'full', 'full', 'face', 'like', 'complete', 'makeup', 'routine', 'So', 'by', 'accident', 'ignorance', 'committed', 'to', 'learning', 'how', 'to', 'apply', 'truly', 'comprehensive', 'makeup', 'routine', 'super', 'nice', 'and', 'awesome', 'redditor', 'already', 'gave', 'me', 'great', 'list', 'of', 'all', 'the', 'different', 'kinds', 'of', 'products', 'involved', 'so', 'now', 'want', 'to', 'do', 'my', 'best', 'to', 'honor', 'that', 'effort', 'and', 'have', 'build', 'spreadsheet', 'to', 'research', 'and', 'formulate', 'routine', 'to', 'work', 'towards', 'But', 'because', 'am', 'very', 'much', 'beginner', 'am', 'sure', 'probably', 'forgot', 'something', 'essential', 'and', 'want', 'to', 'make', 'sure', 'that', 'cover', 'everything', 'before', 'budgeting', 'So', 'here', 'is', 'the', 'draft', 'for', 'the', 'routine', 'with', 'each', 'category', 'ordered', 'by', 'what', 'to', 'apply', 'first', 'BASE', 'Primer', 'Spot', 'Concealer', 'Color', 'Corrector', 'Undereye', 'Concealer', 'Liquid', 'Foundation', 'Concealer', 'Dry', 'Foundation', 'Setting', 'Spray', 'Finishing', 'Spray', 'EYES', 'Eyeshadow', 'Primer', 'Eyeshadow', 'as', 'complicated', 'as', 'can', 'manage', 'Liquid', 'Eyeliner', 'Eyebrow', 'Gel', 'Fake', 'Lashes', 'Mascara', 'Primer', 'Mascara', 'CHEEKS', 'Contour', 'Bronzer', 'Blush', 'Highlighter', 'LIPS', 'Lip', 'Primer', 'Lip', 'Liner', 'Lipstick', 'Lipgloss', 'So', 'what', 'is', 'missing', 'is', 'there', 'someting', 'missing', 'from', 'this', 'routine', 'Should', 'moisturizing', 'be', 'part', 'of', 'it', 'would', 'really', 'appreciate', 'some', 'feedback', 'Bonus', 'question', 'Would', 'you', 'consider', 'nails', 'to', 'be', 'part', 'of', 'makeup', 'It', 'does', 'not', 'seem', 'to', 'get', 'discussed', 'here', 'so', 'kinda', 'hoping', 'can', 'weasel', 'out', 'of', 'that', 'part', 'without', 'feeling', 'like', 'went', 'back', 'on', 'what', 'said', 'would', 'do']",what is missing from this full full face like complete makeup routine so by accident ignorance committed to learning how to apply truly comprehensive makeup routine super nice and awesome redditor already gave me great list of all the different kind of product involved so now want to do my best to honor that effort and have build spreadsheet to research and formulate routine to work towards but because am very much beginner am sure probably forgot something essential and want to make sure that cover everything before budgeting so here is the draft for the routine with each category ordered by what to apply first base primer spot concealer color corrector undereye concealer liquid foundation concealer dry foundation setting spray finishing spray eyes eyeshadow primer eyeshadow a complicated a can manage liquid eyeliner eyebrow gel fake lashes mascara primer mascara cheeks contour bronzer blush highlighter lips lip primer lip liner lipstick lipgloss so what is missing is there someting missing from this routine should moisturizing be part of it would really appreciate some feedback bonus question would you consider nail to be part of makeup it doe not seem to get discussed here so kinda hoping can weasel out of that part without feeling like went back on what said would do

Makeup,"Back to using BareMineralsI have been on the hunt to find the perfect lightweight foundation/tinted moisturizer for my normal/possibly combo skin. I’ve tried countless combinations of moisturizers, primers, foundations and setting powders and nothing is lasting all day without separating or creasing/looking oily. 

I randomly picked up a new BareMinerals matte powder and used it over my normal moisturizer and primer. I had no separation, no flaking, no oiliness, all day. Had a tiny bit of shine after a full day but nothing significant.

Wanted to share in case others are struggling. I really did not think I’d go back to it. I’m 33F and no longer like the high coverage/powdery look. Even with the matte formula it doesn’t look too dry. Using a dense face brush from elf to apply. Color match can be a little tough, but I settled on 2 different shades and mix them together. 

The original formula has a sheen/almost opalescence that I don’t like on my skin (and makes my pores stand out).

Makeup,"Rare Beauty and Hydro Primer for dryness and separation skin?Hiya! I wanted some advice from you beauty gurus. I've always wanted to get into makeup but because of my dry skin, the makeup would constantly separate on my under eyes especially. This time I did my research and I'm no longer going for silicone products- only water-based.

I plan on getting the Hydro Primer by Milk and the Rare Beauty Liquid Touch Brightening Concealer. I heard both of these are water-based and I just wanted to know your guys' thoughts on this?

Makeup,"Need help finding these lip colors![https://ibb.co/JnXYRBS](https://ibb.co/JnXYRBS)

&amp;#x200B;

I'm referencing this soft summer ideal lipstick chart (my season, if you're familiar with season analysis) as these were the colors I had intuitively figured out I needed to be persuing anyways, after trial and error.

&amp;#x200B;

Almost always my issue is that the lipsticks I try are too colorful-- partly because of my low contrast complexion but also just my personal aesthetic preference as well. I get recs for a dusty mauve and then wonder where the hell the DUSTY part of that is, same for dusty roses. If not that, then it's too warm or cool toned. There's some that look like they could be the right colors too but they're shiny satins or lip glosses! :( And I want matte, at most will take a reasonable satin.

&amp;#x200B;

NYX whipped caviar was (way) too colorful, so was ColourPop's U R MINE and Otter, and Elf Tea Rose lip pencil. NYX Honeymoon, ColourPop Cami and Otter are too orange, and Revlon Death Valley is too purple.

&amp;#x200B;

The ones that I HAVE tried and loved were KVD Sanctuary (lipstick. Can't believe it's been discontinued... 😭 If anyone has dupes for that LMK lol) as a desaturated grape and Milani Naked as a true, lip color nude for me.

&amp;#x200B;

I've been eyeing Bite Beauty Cava and Mac Faux and labeled where I THINK and HOPE they'd be on the chart, but I have red circles around the ones I'm still trying to find.

&amp;#x200B;

If anyone has any recs, I'd LOVE to hear them!

Makeup,"lash lift results completely unnoticeableso I got a lash lift and tint nearly two hours ago and my results are almost completely unnoticeable. I saw a ton of pictures online of what a lash lift and tint is supposed to look like but mine look nowhere near as good. in fact, my mom said she can’t see any difference. when I look in the mirror I can see that my lashes are slightly lifted, but not tinted at all, and you won’t even notice the slight lift unless you are EXTREMELY close up to my face ):

are these results common and is it because my of my genetics? I have naturally short, thin, and stick-straight Asian lashes so I’m not sure if this is why they don’t look like anything happened. my esthetician seemed like she was taking her time and she let the tint sit on for what seemed like quite a long time too… is this just a result of crappy genetics or is it a bad job? it cost me $80, $95 after tip and I don’t know if I should call and tell her I’m unsatisfied with my results! I’m very afraid of confrontation. please advise me on what I should do and if this is normal!

Makeup,"Can't find the right foundation for myself - help!I'm fairly new to make up so still hunting for my perfect foundation, and wondering if anyone could please help me. I've been using the Maybelline Superstay 30h foundation (mixing 01 Alabaster with 05 Light Beige to get the right tone). I do like the foundation in terms of how full coverage it is, but it dries so quickly and is so thick that I struggle to blend in my contour or fix mistakes. 

I'm looking for:

* Afforable (no more than £15)
* Full coverage
* Pale, cool skin colour match
* Longish lasting (doesn't rub off easily on masks/general wear)

I've been looking at Revlon ColorStay, Collection Lasting Perfection, L'Oreal Infallible 24hr Freshwear, L'Oreal True Match (or I would stretch to something more expensive like MAC if it really was right for me).

Makeup,"Red, Pink/Mauve and Nude lipsticks, if I were to chose 1, what should I keep?I'm a minimalist and I want to at least keep 3 variety of lippies.

I would use the red one in minimal make up looks (skin tint, brow pencil, blush and lipstick), I want it red or corally just so it makes up the lost eyeliner, just to make it bold, you know.

The pink/mauve would be used in casual events, the whole make up look would be skin tint, brow pencil + concealer to clean up the edges, eyeliner, blush, bronzer and the lipstick.

Nude lipsticks would be for full glam because it neutralize the eye make ups I do when doing grams.

Now, my problem is I cannot find the exact shade I want for the pink/mauve lipstick that I want, so I'm planning to ditch it and keep the red and the nude.

But I'm afraid I would lose variety. I know people around me wouldn't mind, as long as I'm presentable and I don't really care about what other people will think but I feel like I'm losing myself if I only chose one color.

Makeup,"Mascara keeps smudging under my eyes!I've been googling tips on how to stop your mascara from smudging under your eyes and have tried them but they still smudge for me no matter what. I've used setting sprays, setting powders under/over the concealer + foundation, primers, eyelash primers, and tried baking but I always end up getting dark rings on my bottom lids after an hour.  I also remember seeing a post on reddit from this make up artist who used milk of magnesia to keep her clients' makeup from budging but warned not to use it around the eyes. I know waterproof mascaras and tubing mascaras are a thing, but I just wanted to know if there are any other possible ways to keep your non waterproof/non tubing mascara from smudging because I don't want to just toss out the ones I currently have and buy more (I'm definitely gonna buy some tubing mascara once I've completely run out though.)

Makeup,"Does my undertones breakdown makes sense?I’m trying to figure out this whole undertone thing out so please be patient with me.

If i think of undertones in terms of being a result of specific ratio of the 3 primary colors (red, green and blue), and i think or red as being warm, green as being olive and blue as being cool I get 7 main combinations which are commonly found in makeup products: 

Red base = Warm undertone

Red base + green = Peach undertone

Blue base = Cool/pink undertone 

Blue base + green = Rosy undertone

Red-Green-Blue base = Neutral undertone 

Green base = Olive undertone

Green base + Blue = Cool olive undertone 

Green base + Red = Warm olive undertone 

Red-green base = Golden/yellow undertone 

Red-green base + Blue = Cool yellow undertone

Please correct me! as there’re many flaws I’m detecting on there.

P.s by base I mean that this color takes the largest % of the person’s undertone, when it’s just one-color base it means the rest of colors are there but barely visible.. when something is added ‘+’ one of the colors is slightly visible. And when it’s red-green base for example it means they have equal % as well as being the largest there.

Makeup,"I honestly have no idea...I'm in my 50s. Never wore a whole lot of make up in my youth. Had kids young, two boys... 11months apart. By the time I had raised them and they went out on their own? Well... here I am 😊

Never really learned the whole ""make up"" thing. Hoping to change that.

I was gifted a make-up set and a set of brushes. I have normal skin, a few wrinkles. I know I've got to have some sort of ""base"" to work with... but then what? 😁

If you have any suggestions to tutorial videos or other helpful information it would be greatly appreciated. I seriously don't have a clue.

If there's any good eyebrow videos out there... PLEASE send my way! I had chicken pox years back and my hair started falling out. I lost one of my eyebrows and it never grew back. I try to match it to the other but it always looks odd. Don't want to remove the other because if I can't draw one I sure as heck can't draw two... And the thought of tattoos makes me anxious.

Makeup,"Color of CC Cream?I've just started using CC cream daily (Clinique Moisture Surge CC Cream, Light applied with my fingers), and I feel like it's a bit too dark and orange for my skin tone.

Makeup,"How should I do my brows, lids, and eyeshadow?I want my brows to look neater so I could tweeze the hair off but I also want them to look a little less hairy and bushy so I feel like filling them in a little. Everything I use just makes it look like a little too much though, so what colour or tools should I use?

I also want to do a natural looking eyeshadow but it just make me look like I'm in Chinese opera [💀](https://emojipedia.org/skull/) I don't know if it's too pink for my skin. I'm also Chinese and I'm told the shape of my eyes is unusual because they are comparatively deep set. I want to accentuate that but I can't find anyone with a similar eye shape.

Also when I do eyeliner I can't really get in between my eyelashes and it doesn't look nice if I look closely. I want to do a natural lash but again I can't really find anything that looks similar to me.

i have been trying to figure out my eye shape so that i can apply it the way that will look best but i’ve been struggling to figure it out. i think i have round or almond eyes but idk, and i don’t think my eyes are hooded but my crease kinda gets in the way of the eyeliner which makes it hard. i also have slightly different shaped eyes lol so i’m not certain how to deal with that.

Makeup,"Help!! Trying to match discontinued eyeshadowFor years (so many I'm embarrassed to say), I've been using an eye shadow by Laura Mercier called Antique Gold. I've just about run out, and it was discontinued. I'm going crazy trying to find a color that matches or at least comes very close. I found a site that would recreate it for me, but it would be way more affordable to find a comparable color by another brand. My eyes are very sensitive, so I do like to buy high end products. I just love the color.. I have very pale skin and green/blue eyes, and something about it just works.

This link should bring up a photo of the color. Any help is greatly appreciated! I've reached out to Laura Mercier but they didn't have a good replacement. Thank you!!

Makeup,"Foundation Rec: Armani vs Chanel vs NarsI’m trying to find my holy grail that I can wear everywhere…whether it’s work or a wedding or a photoshoot. I’m happy to spend and have a bottle of ‘the one’ rather than multiple foundations lying around.

I fell in love with Chanel vitalumiere 40 after my wedding MUA used it on me but it’s since been discontinued and I’m wondering about the les beiges foundation. It looked incredible in my wedding photos…I was so happy with it!

I love the Armani luminous silk but I can’t find the right shade. I have 6.25 at the moment but it starts looking abit orange in some parts of my face after a while. Also looks like it’s separating on my forehead sometimes but that might be because it’s abit old

Makeup,"Authentic Tinkle brand razorsI found authentic [Tinkle Brand razors](https://www.tinkleyourface.com) if anyone is looking for them. I have been getting them from here for years.

Makeup,"Slight burning feeling when using false lashes - tips?Hello! I just started wearing false lashes and I have an on and off mild burning sensation when I wear them. No swelling or itchiness really. I've tried different Kiss and Duo glues and had the same result, and I tried 1 ""hypoallergenic"" glue that didn't have any stick so it was a no go. The burning sensation does subside after a while so maybe it's just that my eyes need to get used to the weight of the lash? Sometimes I feel like I forget to blink while wearing them lol 

So far the Kiss Aloe Vera glue and Ardell naked lashes seem to be the most comfortable 

I've read in this sub that the burning can be caused by either the lash itself OR the glue having formaldehyde, but I'm not sure where to go from there. Does anyone have tips on different glues or lashes to try? Or maybe I just need to give my eyes time? 

I have hooded, almond eyes but I can cut most lashes to fit me.

Makeup,"""Fancy"" makeup for ""normal"" peopleHey everybody,

sorry for the long post, I hope this is the right place to post this. (Throwaway Account because embarrassing) 

This might be a bit of a stupid question, but what exactly does a kind  of ""fancy"" evening look entail for you, i.e. which products? Youtube Guides vary widely in complexity and seem more like something to aspire to and not something people really do, if that makes sense. Do non-influencer people really use so many layers of things? Stuff like a primer(?) lipstick under the actual lipstick or some kind of ""top coat"" over nailpolish?  Of course I will look up the specifics of how to use them myself, since the topic seems to be truly vast, but I would appreciate a realistic baseline of products.

&amp;#x200B;

For backstory, two friends (female) and I (male) love great food and occasionally go out to eat at some nice places. Since we work at the same office and I live out of town, I occasionally accompany one of the two home to get ready until we go out to eat. I then always wait for over 30 minutes for them to get ready, which sometimes leads to an exaspareted comment about women always taking their time to get ready and all that. Apparently I  got more mean spirited, because last time I got called out about that  and told that things are just taking this long and I should stop with such comments.

In hindsight, regardless of them taking their time or not, they are absolutely right, and I repeatedly made the most standard macho comment ever, so I apologized. But I noticed that I really don't know anything about makeup, despite always being curious about it and wanting to try it myself at some point. I just always felt like it would hurt my ""image"" to ask about it.

Long story short, since I still cannot really believe it takes up to 45 minutes to get ready and I have always been curious about it, I decided to just try it myself. I know some fancy evening makeup is probably a bad place to start and quite expensive, but the plan is not really to look super good, its more to experience what it entails to get ready and prove to myself that I am actually as open as I believe myself to be. (And I am just too embarassed to ask my friends to do it, since it is not quite socially accepted here. You might have noticed, that I felt the need for three paragraphs of justification)

So I appreciate any help!","['Fancy', 'makeup', 'for', 'normal', 'peopleHey', 'everybody', 'sorry', 'for', 'the', 'long', 'post', 'hope', 'this', 'is', 'the', 'right', 'place', 'to', 'post', 'this',

Makeup,"Best waterproof makeup for a funeral?TW// death

I’m desperately looking for recommendations for the best waterproof (meaning: cry-proof) makeup

My dad died last month and I know I’m going to be a mess at his funeral so I was hoping someone would have a recommendation for makeup that I can cry my eyes out in and have it stay put (or at least still look presentable).

Makeup,"Does anyone have a cheap version of Real Chemistry's 3 Minute Peel?Howdy all!!  For a while I've been looking for a chemical exfoliator, but little has come up.

In a box of samples from a friend I found a Real Chemistry 3 Minute Peel, and it's exactly what I'm looking for... except for the price.  At $48 each, I'm hoping someone somewhere has a cheaper exfoliator they can recommend?

It doesn't need a neutralizer, you just rub it on your face with fingertips, and the extra skin falls off.

Any ideas?","['Does', 'anyone', 'have', 'cheap', 'version', 'of', 'Real', 'Chemistry', 'Minute', 'Peel', 'Howdy', 'all', 'For', 'while', 've', 'been', 'looking', 'for', 'chemical', 'exfoliator', 'but', 'little', 'has', 'come', 'up', 'In', 'box', 'of', 'samples', 'from', 'friend', 'found', 'Real', 'Chemistry', 'Minute', 'Peel', 'and', 'it', 'exactly', 'what', 'looking', 'for', 'except', 'for', 'the', 'price', 'At', 'each', 'hoping', 'someone', 'somewhere', 'has', 'cheaper', 'exfoliator', 'they', 'can', 'recommend', 'It', 'doesn', 'need', 'neutralizer', 'you', 'just', 'rub', 'it', 'on', 'your', 'face', 'with', 'fingertips', 'and', 'the', 'extra', 'skin', 'falls', 'off', 'Any', 'ideas']",does anyone have cheap version of real chemistry minute peel howdy all for while ve been looking for chemical exfoliator but little ha come up in box of sample from friend found real chemistry minute peel and it exactly what looking for except for the price at each hoping someone somewhere ha cheaper exfoliator they can recommend it doesn need neutralizer you just rub it on your face with fingertip and the extra skin fall off any idea

Makeup,"How to Remove Super Fine Glitter from Eyeliner?Hello, I recently purchased some Chanel eyeliners that have super fine glitter, and while they make my eyes and whole appearance look gorgeous and I love them, it's very difficult to remove the glitter completely.

Makeup,"I need advice on how to control oil on my face when makeup is appliedMy face has always been oily but it becomes way oiler when makeup is applied. I use a Laura Mercier powder but tbh I’ve never felt like that helps. I apply it before and after foundation.

I use IT cosmetics cc cream or Laura Mercier foundation. I use UD setting spray and recently started using the Morphe one. 

I blot my face throughout the day. However, I just am so tired of the oil coming through an hour or so in. I asked my bf how my face looked (I asked honest opinion because I wanted it) he said my face was very shiny and my makeup looked cakey because of it. Which is how I felt it did also. 


My skincare routine is:

Cerave cream to foam face wash 
Cerave acne foaming wash
Cerave Retinol (2/3 days a week)
Skinfx aha/bha pads (2 days a week)
IT cosmetics moisturizer (nighttime)
Keihls moisturizer (daytime)
Keihls serum (once a week)

Makeup,"Products for skin that needs heavy moisturizer?Hey y'all! I am currently going through the stages of skin purging due to a new acne medication. While my skin is clearing up, I have a lot of redness and scarring I would like to tone down using makeup. 

I have found that any mattifying products I have tried do not sit well on my skin. They tend to settle weirdly and I don't like how they look. Often times concealer refuses to stick to areas under my eyes and around my nose, so I get patchy quickly. I also have dry skin to begin with, and I think my moisturizer is why. 

I'm in the market for products (primer &amp; concealer but I'll take anything you got) that will help me cover some redness. Bonus points if you know of any good moisturizers that play well with said products. 

Current morning skincare prep consists of:
Vanicream Moisturizing Cream 
Innisfree Matte Priming Sunscreen/Cetaphil Mineral Face Sunscreen
NYX Plump Right Back primer 

I have tried Colorpops Hyaluronic Concealer (BAD BAD BAD) and I'm currently using Fenty Beauty's concealer which is much better but still won't stick so some areas on my face. I also really like Laura Merciers Oil Free Tinted Moisturizer but I'd like a concealer to go with it :)

Makeup,"Matte sunscreen with tinted moisturizer for oily acne prone skin?Hey all!

I’m gonna ask a questions that’s been asked a thousand times unfortunately, but I wanted to ask again because I live in Europe and most products mentioned are very difficult to get here.
Since it’s starting to get warmer again and I have to go back to the office, I want to find a tinted moisturizer, or a tinted skincare product, that I can wear daily, preferably doesn’t transfer or turn me into a slick minefield by the end of the day.

I was thinking of using a matte sunscreen as a base (more specifically the LRP anti shine dry touch gel cream sunscreen, love the brand), because most tinted moisturizers and such focus more on a dewy and glowy skin, which I do like but my fellow oily skin gals know it can look more greasy and not dewy on our skin.

The one that I do see keep coming back is the NARS radiant tinted moisturizer, but the name itself makes a bit scared to try it in case it’s too heavy or dewy.

Any other recs for tinted sunscreens and such that I can find easily in Europe, preferably Spain, is most welcome!

Makeup,"Want to look good at a weddingI’m invited to a coworker’s wedding and I volunteered to bartend since she was having trouble finding one and I used to be a bartender. Anyway, she requested I wear a dress and come ready to have fun. I love makeup and think it’s great… on everybody else. Somehow nothing ever looks good on my skin. I can do eye looks and my brows but foundation always looks gross. But since it is a wedding and all my coworkers are about that glam life…I thought it might be a good time to try something different from my bare face. Even with primer, foundation always seems to either cake up or separate and look curdled. I’ve never tried baking and honestly the idea kinda scares me. What do you guys recommend?

Makeup,"Help with under eyes looking cakey with powder!Hello guys,

I’ve been trying so hard to understand how to get my under eyes to look smooth with no creases but it just comes out looking cakey and settles into the creases. 

This is what I do:

I prep my skin with moisturizer and eye cream then I add my foundation (tinted) but I don’t place any under my eyes. Then I put my concealer under my eyes and wait a second before I blend it with a damp beauty blender, I usually do this twice because I have dark under eyes. I make sure to blend any creases before taking a setting powder (Laura mercier) and apply it under my eyes with a powder puff. At first it looks okay but then it starts to suddenly settle into creases and starts looking cakey.

🔎 REVIEW: 


🔸️PATCHINESS: no patchiness 


🔸️BLENDABILITY: very easy to blend out 


🔸️KICK-BACK/FALL-OUT: 


+ experienced severe levels of kick-back in all shades 


+ experienced fall-out from all shades used, the most fall-out being from matte shade 'Stingray' 


🔸️COLOR-STORY CRITIQUE: 


+ this palette inholds the nice 'light-to-dark' gradient that I always look for. The included shades range from light to midtone to deep. There are a few options available to create depth in your look, which drastically improves a palette's versatility (i.e., the types/amount of varying looks you can create). 


+ there are no traditional neutral 'transition shades' included in this particular color-story. 


+ the formula balance ratio in this palette is 8:10 (mattes to non-mattes), &amp; I think a 44% / 56% formula split is fairly balanced, &amp; provides enough range-of-use. I prefer either fairly balanced layouts, OR matte-heavy layouts. 


+ I classify this as a rainbow-esque palette, &amp; I own one similar, 9-pan palette in my collection, but this is unique regarding its size, and I really like the brand's approach toward cosmetics. 


+ there is NOT a matte black in this palette, which I always prefer - as it deems any palette truly 'universal'. 


+ there were no 'dud' shades in this palette. 


+ each shadow features a stamped press design 

...... 

🔸️FORMULA EVALUATION: 

// 

+ | MATTES |: 

• each one is remarkably soft, and all of them maintain the same consistency across the palette 

• the formula is quite dusty and crumbly, so tapping off your brush is a MUST to avoid overapplication 

• they work well in creating gradients 

• it's easy to layer them 

• some shades apply a different tone/color than they appear in their pan. 

• the matte color selections work well together, it's easy to formulate a look 

• this is a more 'buildable' formula (in lieu of being 'directly pigmented'), making it easier to manage and control the formula 

// 

+ | SHIMMERS |: 

• these shimmers are all very smooth in texture, and exceptionally thin 

• all of the shimmers are highly reflective 

• they do not have much of a base pigment, and behave more like 'toppers' 

• they need a bit of building for opaque application 

• there are microglitters in this formula, which can be tough fall-out to remove 

• works perfectly well with a dry brush, works even better with a dampened brush 

...... 

🔸️PACKAGING: 


+ this is a very sturdy, well-designed palette. I can tell that there was a lot of thought put into its creation. The exterior cover is indicative of the shades that you would find inside. 


+ I think this packaging is a great representation of the brand (Nomad Cosmetics), as it's inline with several other products in their destination range. 

...... 

🔸️RECOMMENDATION: I just can't even convey how excited I was to begin to play around with this! This is my first ever Nomad palette, and I've always heard great things about the brand. I love it when a brand not only has amazing ethos, but their actual products also far surpass your expectations. This palette most definitely contains all my type of tones, and I feel really comfortable with this formula. Sometimes I enjoy one-shadow whisps of eye looks, and these shimmers would be absolutely perfect for a sparkly single-shadow look. I'm so excited to continue messing around with this and seeing what else I can create! 

...... 

▪️FINAL CONCLUSION: (recommend) 

+ very easy to work with 

+ brand's uncommon diligence 

+ great for one-shadow, sparkly looks 

...... 

+ Favorite Shade: Shark 

- Least Favorite Shade: Bora Bora 

...... 

🚦 RATING: A 

...... 

⭐ RATING LEGEND: 

A = totally wow'd me 

B = not the best, but I like it 

C = personal bias, nothing wrong w/ product 

D = this didn't work out for me 

F = I totally hate this

to blend out kick back fall out experienced severe level of kick back in all shade experienced fall out from all shade used the most fall out being from matte shade stingray color story critique this palette inholds the nice light to dark gradient that always look for the included shade range from light to midtone to deep there are few option available to create depth in your look which drastically improves palette versatility the type amount of varying look you can create there are no traditional neutral transition shade included in this particular color story the formula balance ratio in this palette is matte to non matte amp think formula split is fairly balanced amp provides enough range of use prefer either fairly balanced layout or matte heavy layout classify this a rainbow esque palette amp own one similar pan palette in my collection but this is unique regarding it size and really like the brand approach toward cosmetic there is not matte black in this palette which always prefer a it deems any palette truly universal there were no dud shade in this palette each shadow feature stamped press design formula evaluation mattes each one is remarkably soft and all of them maintain the same consistency across the palette the formula is quite dusty and crumbly so tapping off your brush is must to avoid overapplication they work well in creating gradient it easy to layer them some shade apply different tone color than they appear in their pan the matte color selection work well together it easy to formulate look this is more buildable formula in lieu of being directly pigmented making it easier to manage and control the formula shimmers these shimmer are all very smooth in texture and exceptionally thin all of the shimmer are highly reflective they do not have much of base pigment and behave more like topper they need bit of building for opaque application there are microglitters in this formula which can be tough fall out to remove work perfectly well with dry brush work even better with dampened brush packaging this is very sturdy well designed palette can tell that there wa lot of thought put into it creation the exterior cover is

I have absolutely zero knowledge when it comes to make up. I am just looking for a setting powder that can help counteract the oiliness of my sunscreen (and skin) over the day.

1) If I buy a tinted powder, would it be able to conceal at least a bit of redness in my face?
2) Used sparingly, would it be noticeable I am wearing a colored powder?

Makeup,"My makeup looks like fuzz on my faceI use CeraVe face cream with SPF30, let it sit for a few minutes, use Smashbox oil and shine control primer and let it sit for a few minutes, and then apply Marcelle flawless xtreme long lasting foundation, and it looks like I have a layer of fuzz on my face. Is this pilling? It looks good from far away but close up, you can see my makeup. 

I thought I was using too many products (Marcelle BB cream then foundation and sometimes light Jane Iredale powder), but scaling back has produced the same fuzzy result. I have combination skin where my cheeks are a bit drier but my t zone is quite oily, and still has a bit of shine after applying makeup if I don't use powder.

Makeup,Testing For Allergies?Hi! Sorry if this has been asked before... But I have sensitive skin and am allergic to almost all forms of adhesive (from painters tape to bandaid) and recently found hypoallergenic bandaids that don't have a reaction. This gave me hope as I have an cosplay event coming up where a strip of fake eyelashes below my eyes would make a huge difference in the anime appearance. I'm expecting to need to try a few options of hypoallergenic glue to see if I react but walking around with a face full of hives for a while won't be an option with my job.

Makeup,"Moisturizers ?Hi. I was going to post in Ulta since the moisturizer I purchased for my daughter came from there … the one I was going to get her is only sold at Sephora. I didn’t want to cross-post and it’s a general question. so thought here may be best. 

My daughter is having double jaw surgery soon. Aside from the lip moisturizer they’ll give her - then it’ll switch when out to just regular Vaseline (for her lips), they’ve said moisturize moisturize moisturize. A. LOT. LOT. LOT. 

So, I picked up: First Aid Beauty’s (FAB) Ultra repair (it was a little trial set with the cleanser and moisturizer) to make sure she liked it. She did/does. The one she wanted to try was: The Inkey List. I just didn’t know it was at Sephora not Ulta 🤦‍♀️

My question is: are those the best? Is one better than the other? She has some dry patches and redness. The FAB seems to help but I’ve read it can make skin dry or cause acne. Maybe there’s a better hydrating moisturizer since her skin is going to swell and be tight and very dry from anesthesia and just not really being able to do much more than wet facial cloths to wash her face after. At least seven to 10 days 😳 depending on how she recovers, swelling, numbness, etc etc etc.

Makeup,"Is it possible my brush cleanser is causing bumps?I cleaned my brushes recently with ecotools brush cleanser which I’ve never used before but saw it was red tagged at my local target. I usually use Johnson’s baby shampoo. 

I applied the Bareminerals original loose powder on today and I saw bumps on my cheeks a few hours later. This has been my HG for a while BUT i haven’t used it in 2 years.

I’ve had crystal clear skin for a while, likely cause I haven’t worn any makeup in ages, so these bumps came as a surprise. Could it be the brush cleanser even though I’m pretty sure I washed it thoroughly? Or my foundation is more likely the culprit?

Makeup,"Does anyone else absolutely hate wearing blush?I’ve only worn blush twice in my whole life - once during a makeup masterclass and once more recently. I was performing on stage and during the dress rehearsal, one of my friends insisted on putting blush on me so I wouldn’t look washed out on stage (her words) and holy smokes, I hated it. Maybe it’s because it wasn’t the right shade or she put it on improperly but both times I’ve worn blush, it looked somewhere between a feverish flush and clown cheeks. I’d invited my partner to see the showcase I was in and I literally had to get them to go back to my flat and get me my makeup so I could redo it because I hated that damn blush so much.

For a while I thought it’s because I’m Arab but I’ve seen Black and darker-skinned people put on blush and it looks good on them. Maybe it’s because I spend so much of my makeup routine trying to counter redness (I use a green concealer) only for it to look wrong when I put more red/pink blush on.

🤓 Veil Cosmetics: Complexion Range - Review &amp; Inquisition 🔎

......

➡️ NOTE: the information contained within this post is based upon my research, opinions, and experience. As always, buy/use the products that make YOU happy. Also, none of my stuff is sponsored. I do it for fun.

......

🔹️Aquirement: gratefully accepted as PR

......

▪️PURPOSE: I randomly came across this brand while researching makeup products, and I've been extremely curious about the product line. Each individual product offered seemed to incorporate everything that I ever wanted out of a makeup product. About a year ago, I tested and reviewed my first Veil Cosmetics product - the Automatte Balm, and after much success with that, my curiosity with the brand grew further. Today, I feel extremely honored to share my experience with the complete complexion range offered by Veil Cosmetics, and hopefully introduce you to this incredible brand.

......

▪️BRAND PROFILE: before we get into each detailed product review, I think it would be beneficial to learn a little bit about the company. Veil Cosmetics was founded by long-time, celebrity, pro-makeup artist Sébastien Tardif. He created a full range of weightless, breathable complexion products that ENHANCE your natural skin, not cover it up. All products are vegan, cruelty-free, and featherweight.

🔎 PRODUCT REVIEWS:

//

Automatte Balm - I've been using this product for approximately a year now, SO much so, that I've severely hit pan on it. It is a staple in my makeup routine, and one I find makes a significant difference in the application of my follow-up products. It consists of a thin, wax-like balm that glides over the skin with ease, and instantly mattifies any unwanted shine. The opulent compact includes a separate compartment, housing a functional and practical application tool (which I use to apply the balm). This balm works quickly, and it's always paired perfectly with other products.

Sunset Light • Primer Serum Mixing Base - this priming serum is supposed to give you an overall smooth canvas, along with the desirable radiance of the 'Golden Hour'. There are no actual sparkling particles in this formula, and it's completely unscented. It felt incredibly refreshing being applied to my skin - I found it to absorb super-fast, leaving no unpleasant residue behind. This primer has a bit of a silicone-slip to it, which worked extremely well to smooth over my most porous areas. This primer gave my skin the absolute most beautiful 'lit-from-within' radiance. I definitely see myself using this product all on its own on my 'no makeup' days, as well as a steadfast base for my more mattifying foundations.

Complexion Fix Concealer - this product is a three-in-one, as it corrects, conceals, and highlights. Upon application, I found it to blend out immensely fast and it looked seamless on my skin. I used it as both a concealer and a corrector, and it completely corrected my eyelid discoloration and evened everything out to my liking. As a concealer, I used it to pre-treat all of my reddened blemishes prior to foundation application. Overall, I achieved a brightened, light-coverage with this, but that's exactly what the product claimed to be. I think this would pair perfectly with my lighter-coverage bases, where I want my natural skin to shine. Throughout my time wearing this concealer, I didn't get any awful undereye creasing, or unsightly settling.

Sunset Skin • Foundation - similar to the priming serum, this foundation is also supposed to convey that coveted 'Golden Hour' glow. This formula is very whipped and airy in texture, and doesn't have a fragrance. I decided to apply it with a brush, and I used only one pump, as I found that a little goes quite a long way. Upon application, the first thing I noticed was its feeling - it was very lightweight and comfortable upon my face. I achieved a medium-covereage level with this (it covered everything well, but I could still see through to blemishes, although any associated redness was gone). Something neat and unique about this particular foundation is that it doesn't need to be set at all, it completely dries down to a silk-like finish without additional layered product. I thoroughly enjoy how this looks on my skin, it feels like a daily workhorse product that I will continuously return to. The glow it provides is striking; this is the type of finish I seek from every foundation. As I continued to wear it, I discovered that the longer you wear this foundation, the better it looks!

▪️OVERALL CONCLUSIONS: each and every product that I tried today impressed me beyond my expectations. I absolutely loved the performance of each product as an individual, but they blew my mind when used combined. I am going to continue using every product, because they are top-tier in my collection. 

......

▪️AFTERWORD:

+ prices in this range are higher-end, as it's a small business and overhead costs are higher 

+ this collection would benefit from a shade range expansion 

+ the component packaging on all of these products is luxurious and complex.

Makeup,"I’m new to using makeup, aside from wearing eyeliner. I’m thinking of what brand of foundation to get.I have combination skin. I bought the Rare Beauty foundation but I came to realize that I do not like how it looks on my skin, it reminded me how the skin of an orange peel looks like. I moisturize and make sure to prime before using foundation. I currently have been using powder foundation from Sephora collection but I want to try different types of foundation. Any suggestions?

Makeup,"Tips on how to find a perfect foundation shade Hello guys :) I was looking for a new foundation and found this ‘Completone’ brand. I have taken their shade quizzes and it seems like it would be a good fit for me, but I wasn’t 100% sure. So I looked up on the internet and gathered some information on how to find the perfect foundation shade.

When you are looking for a foundation, it is important to know your undertone. Your undertone and foundation’s undertone has to match. When you try the foundation on your bare skin and when it melts into your skin seamlessly, that is the right fit for you.   

I looked up several websites and made this undertone chart. 

|  **Cool**| **Neutral** | **Warm**|
|:-|:-|:-|
| Red, Pink, Bluish | Olive or mix |  Yellow, Peachy, Golden|
|  Blue veins |  Balanced|  Green veins|
|  Silver|  Silver / Gold |  Gold|
|  Burns easily|  Tans slightly| Tans easily |
|   Porcelain, Rose, Sable, Cocoa|  Ivory, Buff, Nude, and Praline.|  Beige, Golden, Tan, Caramel, and Chestnut |

&amp;#x200B;

Your skin tone should also be considered. Check around your jawline under the neutral light fair, light, medium or deep. There are different image charts where you can compare your skin tone with the model image. 

Next, based on this skin tone and undertone, find about three shades and test it around your jawline for a few hours if possible. As I said earlier, when the foundation melts into your skin seamlessly, that is the right fit for you. Plus, don’t forget to check your shade again when the weather changes. Your skin changes with the weather.

I highly recommend you put these into your considerations when you buy the foundation. I also think utilizing the quizzes is a good option too. I’ll leave a link where I got my foundation test:  [https://completone.us](https://completone.us/).

Makeup,"Help diagnosing skin tint patchy applicationhello!

I need some help figuring out what the issue I have with skin tints is. I get this weird patchy application that looks awful every time I use one. it doesn't happen with foundation - even hydrating and matte ones.

I've tried Ilia skin tint, Fenty blur tint, and the Rare Beauty tinted moisturizer and it happens with all of them. 

I don't think it's try skin because I make an effort to moisturize well during skin prep. I'm not sure if it's pilling under sunscreen, but it has happened over EltaMD UV Clear, SuperGoop Unseen, and Cerave PM (all of which have pretty different formulas). I'm not currently exfoliating my skin, but that's because I'm on a prescription retinoid and my skin it's still adjusting (it apparently has an exfoliating effect too), so I don't want to damage my barrier.

I don't want to add a primer step because I specifically wanted a tint for quick and easy makeup routines for days like going into work.

ugh. it's so frustrating and I don't know if it's me or the products but Im getting fatigued trying so many out. it's just weird that it doesn't happen with foundation. 

would love some help and advice!!!!

Makeup,"Foundation Makes Skin Look Dry/Textured/HairyHi all,

This has been an issue my whole life and I have no idea how to fix it. My skin routine is simple (wash w/ cerave moisturizing cleaner &amp; moisturize w/ either cerave daily moisturizing lotion or cream). I sometimes use BHA and niacinamide. I have combination skin, very sensitive. Almost everything is too harsh. I’m not interested in shaving my face or any kind of hair removal, as it only shows up when I use foundation! 

As far as makeup, I have tried two different primers and many different foundations. I have used my fingers, a brush, and a sponge — all seem to have the same effect.

Makeup,"What type of foundation is best for dry, extremely pale skin?Please what foundation is best for skin that is extremely pale (closest match, Maybelline Light Porcelain) with cool undertones, no yellow and minimal pink. Need to be very, very pale/white. Skin is prone to dryness when makeup is applied. Most foundations look like damp self-raising flour on my face even with moisturiser so I need one perhaps with an oily consistency? I am a man. I don't mind looking a little greasy.

Makeup,"DIY lash extensions: Lashify, House of Lash, others?I am intrigued by this world of DIY lash extensions.  

They are not like pro extensions, where you go to a shop and the glue individual lashes onto each of your own lashes (1 hour, $100, every 2 weeks).

They are not like full strip lashes, with a band of lashes stuck on lid with temporary adhesive (lasts for the day only).

Some other lash systems have clusters of lashes that go onto the upper side of the lashes with superglue and last a few days.

The systems I'm looking at use mini strips of lightweight lashes on really fine bands that are glued to the underside of the lashes and last for 10 days to 2 weeks.

Can anyone share their experience with these types of systems and give any reviews on Lashify vs House of Lashes vs any other options and how they compare to each other or other systems for time/cost/ease/value?","['DIY', 'lash', 'extensions', 'Lashify', 'House', 'of', 'Lash', 'others', 'am', 'intrigued', 'by', 'this', 'world', 'of', 'DIY', 'lash', 'extensions', 'They', 'are', 'not', 'like', 'pro', 'extensions', 'where', 'you', 'go', 'to', 'shop', 'and', 'the', 'glue', 'individual', 'lashes', 'onto', 'each', 'of', 'your', 'own', 'lashes', 'hour', 'every', 'weeks', 'They', 'are', 'not', 'like', 'full', 'strip', 'lashes', 'with', 'band', 'of', 'lashes', 'stuck', 'on', 'lid', 'with', 'temporary', 'adhesive', 'lasts', 'for', 'the', 'day', 'only', 'Some', 'other', 'lash', 'systems', 'have', 'clusters', 'of', 'lashes', 'that', 'go', 'onto', 'the', 'upper', 'side', 'of', 'the', 'lashes', 'with', 'superglue', 'and', 'last', 'few', 'days', 'The', 'systems', 'looking', 'at', 'use', 'mini', 'strips', 'of', 'lightweight', 'lashes', 'on', 'really', 'fine', 'bands', 'that', 'are', 'glued', 'to', 'the', 'underside', 'of', 'the', 'lashes', 'and', 'last', 'for', 'days', 'to', 'weeks', 'Can', 'anyone', 'share', 'their', 'experience', 'with', 'these', 'types', 'of', 'systems', 'and', 'give', 'any', 'reviews', 'on', 'Lashify', 'vs', 'House', 'of', 'Lashes', 'vs', 'any', 'other', 'options', 'and', 'how', 'they', 'compare', 'to', 'each', 'other', 'or', 'other', 'systems', 'for', 'time', 'cost', 'ease', 'value']",diy lash extension lashify house of lash others am intrigued by this world of diy lash extension they are not like pro extension where you go to shop and the glue individual lash onto each of your own lash hour every week they are not like full strip lash with band of lash stuck on lid with temporary adhesive last for the day only some other lash system have cluster of lash that go onto the upper side of the lash with superglue and last few day the system looking at use mini strip of lightweight lash on really fine band that are glued to the underside of the lash and last for day to week can anyone share their experience with these type of system and give any review on lashify v house of lashes v any other option and how they compare to each other or other system for time cost ease value

Makeup,"Ik Makiage ""Try Before You Buy"" QuestionHey so I was shopping for a new foundation, and came across Ik Makiage and the ""Try before you buy"" caught my interest. I put in an order and used a debit card, and anticipated a pre-authorization charge, they said it wouldn't actually be taken out of my account, but it was, I checked the order and it looks like a regular order, where before I checked out it had the ""try before you buy"" before the product. Now it doesn't. 

I emailed them, and am waiting for a response. I told them the situation and I would want to cancel the order if it isn't the ""Try before you buy"" items. The only message I got back said that they try to reply within 24hrs, which by that time, they could've already shipped it (2pm Est).

Makeup,"Any lip glosses like LA Girl holographic lip topper? Or Hard Candy Glossaholic lip gloss?The LA girl holographic lip topper (flashing opal) is the closet gloss I've found to the Hard Candy Glossaholic in the Hint of Pink or Fairy colors... It's like an iridescent pink/opal with blue effect. The Glossaholic was my absolute favorite and discontinued a few years years back and I've not found anything since. 

Any suggestions for something similar?

Makeup,"Contour for fair skin with neutral undertones? HELP!!!!Hello to anyone taking the time to read my post! I am here looking for recommendations for contour color products.

If it is not applied twice daily my skin immediately begins to peel and flake. It has helped my breakouts too, it's a fantastic product. 

Whenever I have worn foundation in the past, my skin has immediately sucked up all of the moisture, peeled, crumbled and flaked. The foundation comes off very easily too, along with flakes of skin. It looks vile. I have tried all of the budget/shop brands of liquid, cream, mousse, powder and none of them work. I have tried various higher brands (MAC, etc) and they were all far too dark or leeched my skin. I should also stress my skin is pale as a Cullen and has solid blue undertones. Very little pink. I like it this way so I would prefer a foundation as close to white as possible. I have tried various application methods from fingers to sponges to brushes and nothing helped. No primers have helped. Moisturiser does not help either. The same thing happens so I assume it's a matter of unsuitable products. My skin's dryness isn't much of a problem until foundation is applied but my spots are embarrassing me as they always look extremely sore and inflamed. 

Are there any good foundations that provide a full coverage that are extremely white and preferably not too expensive? (the cheaper, the better). As I said, I've tried all the shop brands (May, Rim, LoR, etc). Must be available in the UK. 

Thank you.","['Foundation', 'for', 'extremely', 'white', 'dry', 'skin', 'have', 'extremely', 'thin', 'pale', 'dry', 'skin', 'that', 'is', 'prone', 'to', 'spots', 'My', 'spots', 'show', 'up', 'mostly', 'on', 'my', 'chin', 'and', 'the', 'marks', 'stay', 'there', 'for', 'weeks', 've', 'always', 'had', 'the', 'same', 'issues', 'with', 'dryness', 'and', 'breakouts', 'not', 'acne', 'The', 'only', 'product', 've', 'ever', 'found', 'that', 'helps', 'with', 'the', 'dryness', 'is', 'hemp', 'oil', 'which', 'apply', 'generously', 'twice', 'day', 'If', 'it', 'is', 'not', 'applied', 'twice', 'daily', 'my', 'skin', 'immediately', 'begins', 'to', 'peel', 'and', 'flake', 'It', 'has', 'helped', 'my', 'breakouts', 'too', 'it', 'fantastic', 'product', 'Whenever', 'have', 'worn', 'foundation', 'in', 'the', 'past', 'my', 'skin', 'has', 'immediately', 'sucked', 'up', 'all', 'of', 'the', 'moisture', 'peeled', 'crumbled', 'and', 'flaked', 'The', 'foundation', 'comes', 'off', 'very', 'easily', 'too', 'along', 'with', 'flakes', 'of', 'skin', 'It', 'looks', 'vile', 'have', 'tried', 'all', 'of', 'the', 'budget', 'shop', 'brands', 'of', 'liquid', 'cream', 'mousse', 'powder', 'and', 'none', 'of', 'them', 'work', 'have', 'tried', 'various', 'higher', 'brands', 'MAC', 'etc', 'and', 'they', 'were', 'all', 'far', 'too', 'dark', 'or', 'leeched', 'my', 'skin', 'should', 'also', 'stress', 'my', 'skin', 'is', 'pale', 'as', 'Cullen', 'and', 'has', 'solid', 'blue', 'undertones', 'Very', 'little', 'pink', 'like', 'it', 'this', 'way', 'so', 'would', 'prefer', 'foundation', 'as', 'close', 'to', 'white', 'as', 'possible', 'have', 'tried', 'various', 'application', 'methods', 'from', 'fingers', 'to', 'sponges', 'to', 'brushes', 'and', 'nothing', 'helped', 'No', 'primers', 'have', 'helped', 'Moisturiser', 'does', 'not', 'help', 'either', 'The', 'same', 'thing', 'happens', 'so', 'assume', 'it', 'matter', 'of', 'unsuitable', 'products', 'My', 'skin', 'dryness', 'isn', 'much', 'of', 'problem', 'until', 'foundation', 'is', 'applied', 'but', 'my', 'spots', 'are', 'embarrassing', 'me', 'as', 'they', 'always', 'look', 'extremely', 'sore', 'and', 'inflamed', 'Are', 'there', 'any', 'good', 'foundations', 'that', 'provide', 'full', 'coverage', 'that', 'are', 'extremely', 'white', 'and', 'preferably', 'not', 'too', 'expensive', 'the', 'cheaper', 'the', 'better', 'As', 'said', 've', 'tried', 'all', 'the', 'shop', 'brands', 'May', 'Rim', 'LoR', 'etc', 'Must', 'be', 'available', 'in', 'the', 'UK', 'Thank', 'you']",foundation for extremely white dry skin have extremely thin pale dry skin that is prone to spot my spot show up mostly on my chin and the mark stay there for week ve always had the same issue with dryness and breakout not acne the only product ve ever found that help with the dryness is hemp oil which apply generously twice day if it is not applied twice daily my skin immediately begin to peel and flake it ha helped my breakout too it fantastic product whenever have worn foundation in the past my skin ha immediately sucked up all of the moisture peeled crumbled and flaked the foundation come off very easily too along with flake of skin it look vile have tried all of the budget shop brand of liquid cream mousse powder and none of them work have tried various higher brand mac etc and they were all far too dark or leeched my skin should also stress my skin is pale a cullen and ha solid blue undertone very little pink like it this way so would prefer foundation a close to white a possible have tried various application method from finger to sponge to brush and nothing helped no primer have helped moisturiser doe not help either the same thing happens so assume it matter of unsuitable product my skin dryness isn much of problem until foundation is applied but my spot are embarrassing me a they always look extremely sore and inflamed are there any good foundation that provide full coverage that are extremely white and preferably not too expensive the cheaper the better as said ve tried all the shop brand may rim lor etc must be available in the uk thank you

Makeup,"How do I become good at knowing the best makeup products and techinques again?# Please no rude harsh or patronizing comments.  I'm here for solid advice. I'm lost.

To try to make this short I use to be pretty decent and makeup. I always worn it since I was a kid but I created this immense knowledge of makeup based on numerous hours of researching video after video and taking youtubers advice. Then something tragic happened and years later I ended up rarely wearing makeup, researching it, and even impulsively decluttered all my stuff. Now I'm trying to watch  numerous videos all over again and get back into the game but my anxiety is making me overthink the simplest concepts of makeup. I can't honestly learn how to get back in the game and know the best brands or more specifically what are the best products to buy or not buy. Here are a few things I'm struggling with. For example here is what I can't figure out and need help with, please:

\-What are the most legit, honest, genuine, not product pusher youtubers that you honestly trust their advice on what products to buy?

\-How do I manage learning several best products out there for different things when it appears youtubers now suggest way more options than back in the day? I can't afford to try everything or even 10 foundations.

\-Do I focus on one youtuber and one specific product like blush to see what the best one is she mentions or how much she mentions a certain item? Or do I look at several and what blushes in total everyone uses?

\-How did you guys become so amazing at makeup and have holy grail products or know so many products not to buy or ones you hated if you didn't have a  lot of money to buy a lot in the first place?","['How', 'do', 'become', 'good', 'at', 'knowing', 'the', 'best', 'makeup', 'products', 'and', 'techinques', 'again', 'Please', 'no', 'rude', 'harsh', 'or', 'patronizing', 'comments', 'here', 'for', 'solid', 'advice', 'lost', 'To', 'try', 'to', 'make', 'this', 'short', 'use', 'to', 'be', 'pretty', 'decent', 'and', 'makeup', 'always', 'worn', 'it', 'since', 'was', 'kid', 'but', 'created', 'this', 'immense', 'knowledge', 'of', 'makeup', 'based', 'on', 'numerous', 'hours', 'of', 'researching', 'video', 'after', 'video', 'and', 'taking', 'youtubers', 'advice', 'Then', 'something', 'tragic', 'happened', 'and', 'years', 'later', 'ended', 'up', 'rarely', 'wearing', 'makeup', 'researching', 'it', 'and', 'even', 'impulsively', 'decluttered', 'all', 'my', 'stuff', 'Now', 'trying', 'to', 'watch', 'numerous', 'videos', 'all', 'over', 'again', 'and', 'get', 'back', 'into', 'the', 'game', 'but', 'my', 'anxiety', 'is', 'making', 'me', 'overthink', 'the', 'simplest', 'concepts', 'of', 'makeup', 'can', 'honestly', 'learn', 'how', 'to', 'get', 'back', 'in', 'the', 'game', 'and', 'know', 'the', 'best', 'brands', 'or', 'more', 'specifically', 'what', 'are', 'the', 'best', 'products', 'to', 'buy', 'or', 'not', 'buy', 'Here', 'are', 'few', 'things', 'struggling', 'with', 'For', 'example', 'here', 'is', 'what', 'can', 'figure', 'out', 'and', 'need', 'help', 'with', 'please', 'What', 'are', 'the', 'most', 'legit', 'honest', 'genuine', 'not', 'product', 'pusher', 'youtubers', 'that', 'you', 'honestly', 'trust', 'their', 'advice', 'on', 'what', 'products', 'to', 'buy', 'How', 'do', 'manage', 'learning', 'several', 'best', 'products', 'out', 'there', 'for', 'different', 'things', 'when', 'it', 'appears', 'youtubers', 'now', 'suggest', 'way', 'more', 'options', 'than', 'back', 'in', 'the', 'day', 'can', 'afford', 'to', 'try', 'everything', 'or', 'even', 'foundations', 'Do', 'focus', 'on', 'one', 'youtuber', 'and', 'one', 'specific', 'product', 'like', 'blush', 'to', 'see', 'what', 'the', 'best', 'one', 'is', 'she', 'mentions', 'or', 'how', 'much', 'she', 'mentions', 'certain', 'item', 'Or', 'do', 'look', 'at', 'several', 'and', 'what', 'blushes', 'in', 'total', 'everyone', 'uses', 'How', 'did', 'you', 'guys', 'become', 'so', 'amazing', 'at', 'makeup', 'and', 'have', 'holy', 'grail', 'products', 'or', 'know', 'so', 'many', 'products', 'not', 'to', 'buy', 'or', 'ones', 'you', 'hated', 'if', 'you', 'didn', 'have', 'lot', 'of', 'money', 'to', 'buy', 'lot', 'in', 'the', 'first', 'place']",how do become good at knowing the best makeup product and techinques again please no rude harsh or patronizing comment here for solid advice lost to try to make this short use to be pretty decent and makeup always worn it since wa kid but created this immense knowledge of makeup based on numerous hour of researching video after video and taking youtubers advice then something tragic happened and year later ended up rarely wearing makeup researching it and even impulsively decluttered all my stuff now trying to watch numerous video all over again and get back into the game but my anxiety is making me overthink the simplest concept of makeup can honestly learn how to get back in the game and know the best brand or more specifically what are the best product to buy or not buy here are few thing struggling with for example here is what can figure out and need help with please what are the most legit honest genuine not product pusher youtubers that you honestly trust their advice on what product to buy how do manage learning several best product out there for different thing when it appears youtubers now suggest way more option than back in the day can afford to try everything or even foundation do focus on one youtuber and one specific product like blush to see what the best one is she mention or how much she mention certain item or do look at several and what blush in total everyone us how did you guy become so amazing at makeup and have holy grail product or know so many product not to buy or one you hated if you didn have lot of money to buy lot in the first place

Makeup,"Must have / can’t live without products (&amp; also new recent discoveries you’re currently loving and/or hating lol)Either more high end or drugstore ! I’m very curious lol. Makeup, skincare, haircare etc ..! 

Also would love to hear any new products you’ve tried that you’ve LOVED, and also ones that you think are not worth it !! 

I usually tend to buy more expensive makeup but lately I’ve been LOVING wet n wild bare focus tinted hydrator &amp; also their dewy face primer. Their incognito concealer is also pretty great for me. (**I tend to have more normal skin and prefer a more dewy, natural-ish skin look, but usually add Tartes foundconcealer on top of these if I want more full coverage). I also love tartes glow wand too especially for around my eyebrows. I am obsessed with YSL mascara (recently switched from buxom which I still like but now deff prefer YSL). So random, but shein has these “butter” eyeshadow sticks for like $2 each and they’re AMAZING. Limited colors but I love both shades of brown and use them almost everyday, they blend so easily and don’t get cakey or anything at all! 

I’m sure I’ll think of more because I’m addicted to trying new products lol 😂 but curious what other people have been loving / hating lately !","['Must', 'have', 'can', 'live', 'without', 'products', 'amp', 'also', 'new', 'recent', 'discoveries', 'you', 're', 'currently', 'loving', 'and', 'or', 'hating', 'lol', 'Either', 'more', 'high', 'end', 'or', 'drugstore', 'very', 'curious', 'lol', 'Makeup', 'skincare', 'haircare', 'etc', 'Also', 'would', 'love', 'to', 'hear', 'any', 'new', 'products', 'you', 've', 'tried', 'that', 'you', 've', 'LOVED', 'and', 'also', 'ones', 'that', 'you', 'think', 'are', 'not', 'worth', 'it', 'usually', 'tend', 'to', 'buy', 'more', 'expensive', 'makeup', 'but', 'lately', 've', 'been', 'LOVING', 'wet', 'wild', 'bare', 'focus', 'tinted', 'hydrator', 'amp', 'also', 'their', 'dewy', 'face', 'primer', 'Their', 'incognito', 'concealer', 'is', 'also', 'pretty', 'great', 'for', 'me', 'tend', 'to', 'have', 'more', 'normal', 'skin', 'and', 'prefer', 'more', 'dewy', 'natural', 'ish', 'skin', 'look', 'but', 'usually', 'add', 'Tartes', 'foundconcealer', 'on', 'top', 'of', 'these', 'if', 'want', 'more', 'full', 'coverage', 'also', 'love', 'tartes', 'glow', 'wand', 'too', 'especially', 'for', 'around', 'my', 'eyebrows', 'am', 'obsessed', 'with', 'YSL', 'mascara', 'recently', 'switched', 'from', 'buxom', 'which', 'still', 'like', 'but', 'now', 'deff', 'prefer', 'YSL', 'So', 'random', 'but', 'shein', 'has', 'these', 'butter', 'eyeshadow', 'sticks', 'for', 'like', 'each', 'and', 'they', 're', 'AMAZING', 'Limited', 'colors', 'but', 'love', 'both', 'shades', 'of', 'brown', 'and', 'use', 'them', 'almost', 'everyday', 'they', 'blend', 'so', 'easily', 'and', 'don', 'get', 'cakey', 'or', 'anything', 'at', 'all', 'sure', 'll', 'think', 'of', 'more', 'because', 'addicted', 'to', 'trying', 'new', 'products', 'lol', 'but', 'curious', 'what', 'other', 'people', 'have', 'been', 'loving', 'hating', 'lately']",must have can live without product amp also new recent discovery you re currently loving and or hating lol either more high end or drugstore very curious lol makeup skincare haircare etc also would love to hear any new product you ve tried that you ve loved and also one that you think are not worth it usually tend to buy more expensive makeup but lately ve been loving wet wild bare focus tinted hydrator amp also their dewy face primer their incognito concealer is also pretty great for me tend to have more normal skin and prefer more dewy natural ish skin look but usually add tartes foundconcealer on top of these if want more full coverage also love tartes glow wand too especially for around my eyebrow am obsessed with ysl mascara recently switched from buxom which still like but now deff prefer ysl so random but shein ha these butter eyeshadow stick for like each and they re amazing limited color but love both shade of brown and use them almost everyday they blend so easily and don get cakey or anything at all sure ll think of more because addicted to trying new product lol but curious what other people have been loving hating lately

I have 3 questions:
1.  Why do many moisturizers leave a shininess on my skin and seem to not be absorbed?
2. Why do some moisturizers pull up and not absorb?  Even expensive ones.
3. Is there a moisturizer than can visibly plump skin up (temporarily)?  I don’t think any moisturizer I’ve used does that to any noticeable extent.

Makeup,"New here and ISO a primer spray and a setting sprayHello been reading all the event posts and learning so much already!

Alright, I've never been much of a daily makeup wear-er but I've recently fallen victim to ""clean girl"" / ""that girl"" makeup on tik tok and have been LOVING the easy daily glowy-natural makeup look and the boost of confidence I didn't know makeup would give me!

SO, I do my skincare and then apply my bliss sunblock. This as been functioning as my primer and then I dive into my makeup routine which starts with the CT Flawless filter. I don't love the way this sits on the sunblock. So I am now thinking I could use a makeup primer spray post sunblock pre flawless filter?? Any recs?? I am thinking UD quick fix (although this seems more skin carey than makeup primey) Too Faced 3 in 1, or the Mac Prime+ Fix+. I have rare beauty 4 in 1 that I've tried but i don't like it. Kinda oily and doesn't dry down.


If it matters, step two of my makeup is UD hydromaniac tinter moisturizer. Final step is I have been using UD setting spray but it sorta removes some of my glowy dew. Has anyone tried the new UD setting with Vitamin C and Cactus water? Would this be a little more dewy then the OG? I can't commit to UD's Ultra glow spray that sounds like too much. My other thought is to get the CT setting spray.

Any advice would be lovely!

Makeup,"Foundation for very light, pink skinI've been struggling to find a liquid foundation that suits my skin tone ever since I started doing my makeup. I'm ultra pale and ultra pink, but I quite enjoy it, so I don't want a foundation that will make me look like I've got neutral undertone. My skin is also oily and acne-prone, so foundation must work with that too.

Usually I use matte mineral foundation from Annabelle Minerals (I think it's only available in part of Europe, but maybe some of you know this brand) in beige fairest and it works pretty well in my everyday makeup, but I would like to have something liquid (so it works better with liquid blush and maybe has more coverage) as well.

I've tried Nabla's Close-Up Futuristic Foundation in L15, but it was way too dark for me (even with a fair amount of lightening mixer) and looked yellow/orange on my skin.

Makeup,"Eye makeup makes my eyes water like crazy. Would a lash lift and tint potentially be a solution or would the chemicals make my eyes go crazy for weeks?Or any makeup recommendations from anyone who has experienced this type of thing? I've tried lots of brands including ""hypoallergenic"" like Almay, Physician's Formula, Clinique, etc. Anything liquid like mascara and liquid/gel/ink eyeliner is the worst, I can mostly tolerate eye shadow and pencil eyeliner.

Makeup,"Makeup looking bad all of a sudden :(Hey all! First time here, as well as my first time asking for help with this so go easy in me :)

After a good period of time wearing little if any makeup (not leaving the house throughout the pandemic!!) I recently got a new job working in retail, and just generally have been wearing makeup for longer periods of time than I have in a while. I have super oily skin, get the odd breakout here and there but it’s generally pretty clear and even. I used to get those tiny little bumps but investing in a bit of skincare has cleared that up and reduced my oil too. Usually I put my makeup on (I don’t wear a heavy amount, I use a light-medium coverage foundation or BB cream, and the Rare beauty concealer) and I’d say it looks it’s best at about the 1-2 hour mark. After that it starts to look kind of dry and gross from there on out. My theory is that oil is just breaking it down, but that doesn’t really explain why my face looks rough and dehydrated. 

It also seems like my mascara kind of fades away too, I’ve tried different kinds and they all seem to do it :( I’ve tried different moisturisers and powders (or no powder at all), no change. I haven’t tried primer, but I’m trying to avoid layering too much on because I also use the mecca sunscreen (I’ve tried with others/without it, no change) under everything and I find if I layer too many products they bead up and rub off when I apply foundation. I’m not using expired products, or anything wildly different to what I used pre-pandemic, I’m wondering if it’s just my skin being a few years older than it was when I used to wear make up for this long/as often (been a while since I did 6+ hour days in retail, like, a few years before the pandemic). 

I plan to ask at Sephora and Mecca too next time I’m in, but just wondering if anyone here has some pointers or products. I’m not adverse to trying a new foundation, so if anyone has a good one for oily skin (that has reallyyyy light colours, I’m super fair) then let me know. Would be much appreciated x","['Makeup', 'looking', 'bad', 'all', 'of', 'sudden', 'Hey', 'all', 'First', 'time', 'here', 'as', 'well', 'as', 'my', 'first', 'time', 'asking', 'for', 'help', 'with', 'this', 'so', 'go', 'easy', 'in', 'me', 'After', 'good', 'period', 'of', 'time', 'wearing', 'little', 'if', 'any', 'makeup', 'not', 'leaving', 'the', 'house', 'throughout', 'the', 'pandemic', 'recently', 'got', 'new', 'job', 'working', 'in', 'retail', 'and', 'just', 'generally', 'have', 'been', 'wearing', 'makeup', 'for', 'longer', 'periods', 'of', 'time', 'than', 'have', 'in', 'while', 'have', 'super', 'oily', 'skin', 'get', 'the', 'odd', 'breakout', 'here', 'and', 'there', 'but', 'it', 'generally', 'pretty', 'clear', 'and', 'even', 'used', 'to', 'get', 'those', 'tiny', 'little', 'bumps', 'but', 'investing', 'in', 'bit', 'of', 'skincare', 'has', 'cleared', 'that', 'up', 'and', 'reduced', 'my', 'oil', 'too', 'Usually', 'put', 'my', 'makeup', 'on', 'don', 'wear', 'heavy', 'amount', 'use', 'light', 'medium', 'coverage', 'foundation', 'or', 'BB', 'cream', 'and', 'the', 'Rare', 'beauty', 'concealer', 'and', 'say', 'it', 'looks', 'it', 'best', 'at', 'about', 'the', 'hour', 'mark', 'After', 'that', 'it', 'starts', 'to', 'look', 'kind', 'of', 'dry', 'and', 'gross', 'from', 'there', 'on', 'out', 'My', 'theory', 'is', 'that', 'oil', 'is', 'just', 'breaking', 'it', 'down', 'but', 'that', 'doesn', 'really', 'explain', 'why', 'my', 'face', 'looks', 'rough', 'and', 'dehydrated', 'It', 'also', 'seems', 'like', 'my', 'mascara', 'kind', 'of', 'fades', 'away', 'too', 've', 'tried', 'different', 'kinds', 'and', 'they', 'all', 'seem', 'to', 'do', 'it', 've', 'tried', 'different', 'moisturisers', 'and', 'powders', 'or', 'no', 'powder', 'at', 'all', 'no', 'change', 'haven', 'tried', 'primer', 'but', 'trying', 'to', 'avoid', 'layering', 'too', 'much', 'on', 'because', 'also', 'use', 'the', 'mecca', 'sunscreen', 've', 'tried', 'with', 'others', 'without', 'it', 'no', 'change', 'under', 'everything', 'and', 'find', 'if', 'layer', 'too', 'many', 'products', 'they', 'bead', 'up', 'and', 'rub', 'off', 'when', 'apply', 'foundation', 'not', 'using', 'expired', 'products', 'or', 'anything', 'wildly', 'different', 'to', 'what', 'used', 'pre', 'pandemic', 'wondering', 'if', 'it', 'just', 'my', 'skin', 'being', 'few', 'years', 'older', 'than', 'it', 'was', 'when', 'used', 'to', 'wear', 'make', 'up', 'for', 'this', 'long', 'as', 'often', 'been', 'while', 'since', 'did', 'hour', 'days', 'in', 'retail', 'like', 'few', 'years', 'before', 'the', 'pandemic', 'plan', 'to', 'ask', 'at', 'Sephora', 'and', 'Mecca', 'too', 'next', 'time', 'in', 'but', 'just', 'wondering', 'if', 'anyone', 'here', 'has', 'some', 'pointers', 'or', 'products', 'not', 'adverse', 'to', 'trying', 'new', 'foundation', 'so', 'if', 'anyone', 'has', 'good', 'one', 'for', 'oily', 'skin', 'that', 'has', 'reallyyyy', 'light', 'colours', 'super', 'fair', 'then', 'let', 'me', 'know', 'Would', 'be', 'much', 'appreciated']",makeup looking bad all of sudden hey all first time here a well a my first time asking for help with this so go easy in me after good period of time wearing little if any makeup not leaving the house throughout the pandemic recently got new job working in retail and just generally have been wearing makeup for longer period of time than have in while have super oily skin get the odd breakout here and there but it generally pretty clear and even used to get those tiny little bump but investing in bit of skincare ha cleared that up and reduced my oil too usually put my makeup on don wear heavy amount use light medium coverage foundation or bb cream and the rare beauty concealer and say it look it best at about the hour mark after that it start to look kind of dry and gross from there on out my theory is that oil is just breaking it down but that doesn really explain why my face look rough and dehydrated it also seems like my mascara kind of fade away too ve tried different kind and they all seem to do it ve tried different moisturisers and powder or no powder at all no change haven tried primer but trying to avoid layering too much on because also use the mecca sunscreen ve tried with others without it no change under everything and find if layer too many product they bead up and rub off when apply foundation not using expired product or anything wildly different to what used pre pandemic wondering if it just my skin being few year older than it wa when used to wear make up for this long a often been while since did hour day in retail like few year before the pandemic plan to ask at sephora and mecca too next time in but just wondering if anyone here ha some pointer or product not adverse to trying new foundation so if anyone ha good one for oily skin that ha reallyyyy light colour super fair then let me know would be much appreciated

......

▪️ DESIGNATION: rosey-toned neutral 

......

▪️ DEXTERITY CONCERNS: yes; this palette is quite difficult to open do to its closure-system

💲 $0.39 / gram 

......

♦️ PRICE PER SHADE SCALE:

&lt;$2=excellent; $3-$4=affordable; $5-$8=meh; $9-$15=expensive; &gt;$16=very expensive 


• Comparing this palette to similar products available on the market, the price-per-shade is 'excellent'. Additionally, this palette has a VERY affordable cost-per-gram compared to other palettes I've previously reviewed.

......

🔎 REVIEW: 


🔸️PATCHINESS: no patchiness 

🔸️BLENDABILITY: very easy to blend out 

🔸️KICK-BACK/FALL-OUT: 

+ experienced kick-back in all shades used 

+ experienced fall-out from the metallic shades (none from the matte shades), the most fall-out being from metallic shade '15' 


🔸️COLOR-STORY CRITIQUE: 

+ this palette doesn't really convey the 'light-to-dark' gradient that I always seek. The included shades range from light to midtone. There are no options available to create depth in your look, which drastically limit a palette's versatility (i.e., the types/amount of varying looks you can create). 

+ there are a few neutral 'transition shades' included in this particular color-story. I am unsure how they will fare on a range on skintones. 

+ the formula balance ratio in this palette is 3:12 (mattes to non-mattes), &amp; I think a 20% / 80% formula split shows that it's leaning heavily 'matte'. I prefer either completely balanced layouts, OR matte-heavy. 

+ I classify this as a rosey-toned neutral palette, &amp; I own similar palettes like this in my collection, but none that boast this many shades at such an affordable cost. 

+ there is NOT a matte black in this palette, which I always prefer - as it deems any palette truly 'universal'. 

+ throughout exploring this entire palette, I DID encounter a 'dud' shade. The shade '14' is technically part of the metallics, but it is awful. It is not on par with any of the other metallic shades. It lacks movement, as well as any shine in the formula. It's also very difficult to maneuver and work with. 

......

🔸️FORMULA EVALUATION: 

//

+ | MATTES |: 

• each one is velvetlike, and all of them maintain the same consistency across the palette

• they work well in creating gradients 

• layering them is possible, &amp; quite simple 

• they apply lighter-in-tone than they appear in the pan. 

• it required a lot to build them up to reach their maximum potential 

• this is a more 'buildable' formula (in lieu of being 'directly pigmented'), making it easier to manage and control the formula

//

+ | METALLICS |: 

• these shimmers are very brittle, having quite a thick, flakey texture

• all metallics (except the dud) are extremely reflective and high-shine

• each one has a base pigment, making them multifunctional 

• these metallics don't need much building for a perfected, foiled finish

• works perfectly well with a dry brush, works even better with a dampened brush

......

🔸️PACKAGING: 

+ sturdy, plastic-casings are my favorite type of eyeshadow palette packaging. I prefer them, as they stand to protect the fragile shadows within from sustaining any accidental damage. 

+ I think this packaging is a great representation of the brand (Makeup Revolution), as it's inline with several other products in this familial range.

......

🔸️RECOMMENDATION: today, I just wanted to do a very soft, low-maintenance eyeshadow look. Considering there are only 3 mattes in this palette, there's only a very limited amount of ways you can truly approach this color-story. What REALLY impressed me, were the metallics. I was surely not expecting that reflectivity out of a $6 palette. It's quite shocking, really. The 'Reloaded' palette line has SEVERAL (and by that, I mean like 20 or so) other palettes in this line, and I've always been curious about them. I now feel satisfied, as finally having tried one out. It's not the greatest thing in the world, but it's certainly earned every part of its $6 price tag. 

......

▪️FINAL CONCLUSION: (recommend)

+ very easy to work with

+ beautiful, highly-reflective metallics

+ pick-up-and-go palette 

......

+ Favorite Shade: #5

- Least Favorite Shade: #14

......

🚦 RATING: B

......

⭐ RATING LEGEND:

A = totally wow'd me

B = not the best, but I like it

C = personal bias, nothing wrong w/ product

D = this didn't work out for me

F = I totally hate this

similar product available on the market the price per shade is excellent additionally this palette ha very affordable cost per gram compared to other palette ve previously reviewed review patchiness no patchiness blendability very easy to blend out kick back fall out experienced kick back in all shade used experienced fall out from the metallic shade none from the matte shade the most fall out being from metallic shade color story critique this palette doesn really convey the light to dark gradient that always seek the included shade range from light to midtone there are no option available to create depth in your look which drastically limit palette versatility the type amount of varying look you can create there are few neutral transition shade included in this particular color story am unsure how they will fare on range on skintones the formula balance ratio in this palette is matte to non matte amp think formula split show that it leaning heavily matte prefer either completely balanced layout or matte heavy classify this a rosey toned neutral palette amp own similar palette like this in my collection but none that boast this many shade at such an affordable cost there is not matte black in this palette which always prefer a it deems any palette truly universal throughout exploring this entire palette did encounter dud shade the shade is technically part of the metallic but it is awful it is not on par with any of the other metallic shade it lack movement a well a any shine in the formula it also very difficult to maneuver and work with formula evaluation mattes each one is velvetlike and all of them maintain the same consistency across the palette they work well in creating gradient layering them is possible amp quite simple they apply lighter in tone than they appear in the pan it required lot to build them up to reach their maximum potential this is more buildable formula in lieu of being directly pigmented making it easier to manage and control the formula metallics these shimmer are very brittle having quite thick flakey texture all metallic except the dud are extremely reflective and high shine each one ha base pigment making them multifunctional these metallic don need much building for perfected foiled finish work perfectly well with dry brush work even better with dampened brush packaging sturdy plastic casing are my favorite type of eyeshadow palette packaging prefer them a they stand to protect the fragile shadow within from sustaining any accidental damage think this packaging is great representation of the brand makeup revolution a it inline with several other product in this familial range recommendation today just wanted to do very soft low maintenance eyeshadow look considering there are only matte in this palette there only very limited amount of way you can truly approach this color story what really impressed me were the metallic wa surely not expecting that reflectivity out of palette it quite shocking really the reloaded palette line ha several and by that mean like or so other palette in this line and ve always been curious about them now feel satisfied a finally having tried one

Makeup,"Makeup mirror frustration?? Sick of leaning over my sink.Why are mirrors designed for makeup application so limited?? Based on searches, it looks like at least around half of us stand to put on our makeup. But there's such a limited mirror selection for anyone who stands and it's honestly kind of ridiculous. 
I think a ton of us lean over our sinks, and it's just dumb. 
My back hurts. 

Our Makeup Mirror Options: 

Option 1: 

Sit! There's 7532578 mirror options for those who have a dedicated vanity! 
Oh you don't have the space and/or money for an entirely dedicated makeup vanity? Or maybe that just seems a little excessive for your style? Oh... Uh...? Hm.

Option 2:

Wall mounted vanity mirrors:

1) Basically shows 90% of your face on one side because you're only gonna ever wanna be 90% ready looking at best, amiright?? 
The other side of the mirror:
This option affords you the ability to see the deepest darkest depths of every grueling detail of your face so you can finally see into the epic future of the cells and golden triangle ratios of all the science inside your face. 
Also check out that speck of dust from 2017 still chillin in your nose pore ᕕ( ᐛ )ᕗ

2) Vertically adjustable? Why? You're only one height.
You just have to *perfectly* mount it to your *exact* height Np! Uh... you want to share it with another makeup user...? Have shoes on of varying height? Or maybe you worked out hard that day and you're actually a little bit shorter...?? No. Not allowed. Only perfectly mounted to your one exact height right now, and don't screw it up; it's holes in your wall. 

3) If you want one of either of the previous options, cool! You can pick only one... but then whatever lighting you got going on, good luck! :D 

4) Indecisive? That's okay, there's 4000 options that vary only by 3 degrees, so as long as you know what CoLoR you want, you're good! 


Option 3:

Countertop mirrors:
You... Stand? You sure you don't want to double over? Or look up at your face like you flipped your phone camera? Are you *REALLY* sure...? 


Honestly, how are there so many identical copies of a super mediocre product when there are so many ways of easily improving on this. 


/rant. Thanks for getting this far.

Makeup,"App for skin tone detection and search for matching productsA few months ago, my wife shared how difficult it might be to find the right foundation tone: whatever she orders online, she buys a few samples and eventually throws away those that do not work. Especially during COVID-19 lockdown - you cannot try it out in the shop. 

As a software engineer, I decided to challenge myself and try to create an app to help figure out skin tone and match foundation products. I have just released the first version, available on [iOS](https://testflight.apple.com/join/RTVeujpW) and [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.unotone) \- [http://unotone.com/](http://unotone.com/).  The app flow is quite simple: 

1. Take a photo of your skin, then crop the desired skin fragment.

2. After analyzing your skin tone, the app suggests several tone samples. 

3. Click on a sample from the list that best matches your skin tone. 

3. The app will find a foundation product that perfectly suits your skin color. 

Luckily for me,  my wife doesn't buy so many foundations to test if app detection works very well, so I would be happy to have feedback from you. Let me know if you'll be able to find a perfect match; what you would like to add or change.

Makeup,"Can you help a mom figure out makeup?I'm a stay-at-home parent for the last 10 years.  Pre-pandemic, I used drug store makeups.  During the pandemic, I stopped wearing makeup all together.  Most of my peers are low-to-no-makeup wearers.  And I missed that part of girlhood where you learn how-to makeup (grew up rural, went to mid-western colleges). 

So!  I'm asking for advice!  Where should a mom go to get some basic advice on day-to-day make up?  Or to have someone walk me through all these new products.  I'm a gen x person, so I'm imagining a department store make up counter, but that is like two generations ago.  And like I said, most of my peers don't wear much.

My goals are to find a simple face for the few times I need to look more put together.  Church volunteer work. Leading activities with my kid's social groups.  And to find something slightly more dramatic for some of my mom's nights out and date nights.  (Nothing wild, just darker eyeliner and a heavier lip.)

Makeup,"Wedding makeup HELPHello! 
I’m getting married in July and since it is a destination wedding (kind of in the middle of nowhere) there are no makeup artists in the area. 

I’ve started trying to get into makeup. I’ve purchased Estée Lauder double wear liquid foundation, Anastasia Beverly Hills loose powder, Better Than Sex (waterproof) mascara, Tarte Shape Tape as well as ELF poreless primer and some nice blush and bronzer. Everything has been going really well! I’ve been applying everyday to get the hang of it… there is just one problem…. EVERY TIME I apply it, I get horrible smile lines and the makeup starts to look not as airbrushed around my mouth as my cheeks.

Makeup,"How do I apply concealer when it keeps separating on my skin??I've been playing with makeup since I was a freshman in high school, but never have I been able to apply makeup without it separating or looking super dry on my skin? I actually have a great skincare routine but even with it, the concealer will still go dry within a minute or so? I've tried the primer then baking powder trick; cooling your concealer onto your skin first trick; using a brush instead of a sponge; even applying little makeup so that it won't gather up and disappear, but it all comes out the same! 

I really wanna get into makeup more often, but I keep getting discouraged by the stupid foundation or concealer by it continually separating or looking dry as hell. The primers I use are Elf Hydrating Primer and the concealer I use is Elf Hydrating concealer. Please help! I don't have any makeup friends in the community, at this point, I really don't know which techniques I'm doing that is horrible or if it is my products. If anyone is wondering, I have dry/dehydrated skin.

Makeup,"NC30-NC35 looks too orange on me.Every summer and winter a sales associates from Mac matches me to the shade range of NC30-NC35. They claim that it’s perfect but whenever I come home and put on a swatch on my face, it looks too orange. Like a deep tan spray.

Makeup,"Looking for light coverage, seamless blending foundation/tinted moisturizer. *Natural finish*I’ve been on the hunt for a holy grail, natural looking, light coverage product for years and just haven’t found the right combo.

I’ve read through a ton of previous posts on here about mixing bases (water vs oil), application (sponge, fingers, brush), and layering (serums, moisturizers, makeup). 

I’m struggling with any and all product looking patchy/spotty throughout the day. I’ve tried 4 different setting powders and countless foundations/tinted moisturizers.

I think I have normal/combo skin but with some redness and fairly large pores. I exfoliate, I use a light moisturizer and give it time to soak in before applying makeup. I’ve tried setting sprays. I feel like I’ve tried every combo/order of application.

I’m looking for a seamless blend, natural finish product. The formulas that have come the closest would be Saie Slip Tint (but it looks greasy without a powder, or eventually looks spotty/separates with a powder), Tower 28 (eventually separates, looks a bit flakey with powder) and the Charlotte Tilbury Hollywood Filter - (but it’s a glowy finish - not what I’m after). 

Setting powders I’ve tried: IT cosmetics (pressed), Glossier (loose), Bare Minerals (pressed and loose). ***Are these the problem?? 

I don’t want to look greasy or completely matte. Just natural, no makeup look. 

Please help!

Makeup,"How has your makeup routine changed in the past 5-years?I’m constantly amazed with my changing preferences in products, styles, and colours. I know a lot of this has to do with fashion trend cycles, but when I was beating my face to the gods in 2017, I thought some of my constant repurchases would be used until the end of time! Bury me with my Too Faced Palettes, I thought. 

Eyes: 
I was a Kat Von D (now KVD Beauty) Tattoo Liner enthusiast. The perfect, harsh winged liner. This winged obsession hasn’t changed much because I still love a winged liner (partial to the Rare Beauty one currently!), however I’ve also find myself reaching for the Charlotte Tilbury Eye Pencil in Pillow Talk for a more natural wing. I never would have considered anything but a black winged liner 5-years ago— pencils seemed like a thing of the past back then! Now we’ve embraced them again. 

Cheek Products; 
I wore more orange toned blushes and was a fan of Nars Orgasm. Now I prefer bright pops of pink, I really like Milk Makeup’s cream blushes as well as Ilia’s ones. My blush placement is also much higher and I bring it up to my forehead like I used to do with my bronzer. Also my highlighter game (cough cough Becca) will never be as bright as it was then. My cheeks will never look as frosty as they did in 2017. 

Lip Products: 
My relationship with mauve lipsticks was a never ending repurchasing cycle. Urban Decay’s Vice Lipstick in Backtalk owned me. I used to walk down the hill from University during breaks between class just to buy a replacement because that lipstick was my identity. Now with the pandemic it is a bit hard, however I do prefer a more sheer lipstick. I’m currently loving the Fenty ones! I’ve also been use the Milk lip and cheek products. These days, I avoid mauve lipsticks like the plague because I think they really washed me out, especially the cooler toned ones…

Tools: 
When did my fingers become the new brushes and sponge???? I really like products from rms beauty where I can really feel and mould the cream products (eg. their concealer that I use religiously). My entire beauty collection was inspired by influencers, which included a multitude of brushes and sponges (tools I do still use, but I’m far less rigid about it when so many of the products I use, benefit from a lighter hand (literally!) 

These are the things I’m constantly thinking about as my makeup routine has evolved and changed. Has anyone else had changes you just couldn’t see yourself having 5-years ago???? It’s currently almost 1am in New Zealand, so yes these are my late night shower thoughts.","['How', 'has', 'your', 'makeup', 'routine', 'changed', 'in', 'the', 'past', 'years', 'constantly', 'amazed',

Makeup,"Spring skincare TipsHi there! I have brought some spring skincare tips to share for today. 

Before I give you some tips, ‘everyone has their own allergies and problems including different conditions’. Please make sure that these are ‘tips’, not ‘prescriptions’.

Did you know that you can get a shining skin from home without spending $$$ to a dermatologist? These are the secret tips from the staff of dermatologys. 

When spring comes, your skin conditions change, so you need to change your daily routine. 

&amp;#x200B;

**1. Exfoliation** \- LHA cleansing

We all already know about AHA, and BHA cleansers. Now it's time for LHA cleansers. LHA has the smallest particle therefore there is less irritation. For those who have sensitive and acne skin can also use it. It will make your skin smooth and shine. 

&amp;#x200B;

**2. Moisturizing** 

After you finish cleansing, gently wrap your skin with the tower. The moisture inside your skin quickly flies out to the air, so you need to moisture it right away. Use highly moisturizing products such as 'Serumkind - Deep Antarctic Drop', or ' innisfree - Green tea seed serum/cream'.                                                  

&amp;#x200B;

**3. Sunscreen** 

\- During spring the ultraviolet rays are 1.5times stronger than when it is fall. Sunscreen is a must have item for skincare. It is recommended to apply every time you go out and reapply every 2-3 hours. Don't forget to check PA and SPF when you buy the product. In spring SPF50 PA+++ or higher is recommended. 

&amp;#x200B;

Well, I hope these tips are helpful and hope you all have a wonderful spring skincare routine!","['Spring', 'skincare', 'TipsHi', 'there', 'have', 'brought', 'some', 'spring', 'skincare', 'tips', 'to', 'share', 'for', 'today', 'Before', 'give', 'you', 'some', 'tips', 'everyone', 'has', 'their', 'own', 'allergies', 'and', 'problems', 'including', 'different', 'conditions', 'Please', 'make', 'sure', 'that', 'these', 'are', 'tips', 'not', 'prescriptions', 'Did', 'you', 'know', 'that', 'you', 'can', 'get', 'shining', 'skin', 'from', 'home', 'without', 'spending', 'to', 'dermatologist', 'These', 'are', 'the', 'secret', 'tips', 'from', 'the', 'staff', 'of', 'dermatologys', 'When', 'spring', 'comes', 'your', 'skin', 'conditions', 'change', 'so', 'you', 'need', 'to', 'change', 'your', 'daily', 'routine', 'amp', 'x200B', 'Exfoliation', 'LHA', 'cleansing', 'We', 'all', 'already', 'know', 'about', 'AHA', 'and', 'BHA', 'cleansers', 'Now', 'it', 'time', 'for', 'LHA', 'cleansers', 'LHA', 'has', 'the', 'smallest', 'particle', 'therefore', 'there', 'is', 'less', 'irritation', 'For', 'those', 'who', 'have', 'sensitive', 'and', 'acne', 'skin', 'can', 'also', 'use', 'it', 'It', 'will', 'make', 'your', 'skin', 'smooth', 'and', 'shine', 'amp', 'x200B', 'Moisturizing', 'After', 'you', 'finish', 'cleansing', 'gently', 'wrap', 'your', 'skin', 'with', 'the', 'tower', 'The', 'moisture', 'inside', 'your', 'skin', 'quickly', 'flies', 'out', 'to', 'the', 'air', 'so', 'you', 'need', 'to', 'moisture', 'it', 'right', 'away', 'Use', 'highly', 'moisturizing', 'products', 'such', 'as', 'Serumkind', 'Deep', 'Antarctic', 'Drop', 'or', 'innisfree', 'Green', 'tea', 'seed', 'serum', 'cream', 'amp', 'x200B', 'Sunscreen', 'During', 'spring', 'the', 'ultraviolet', 'rays', 'are', '5times', 'stronger', 'than', 'when', 'it', 'is', 'fall', 'Sunscreen', 'is', 'must', 'have', 'item', 'for', 'skincare', 'It', 'is', 'recommended', 'to', 'apply', 'every', 'time', 'you', 'go', 'out', 'and', 'reapply', 'every', 'hours', 'Don', 'forget', 'to', 'check', 'PA', 'and', 'SPF', 'when', 'you', 'buy', 'the', 'product', 'In', 'spring', 'SPF', 'PA', 'or', 'higher', 'is', 'recommended', 'amp', 'x200B', 'Well', 'hope', 'these', 'tips', 'are', 'helpful', 'and', 'hope', 'you', 'all', 'have', 'wonderful', 'spring', 'skincare', 'routine']",spring skincare tipshi there have brought some spring skincare tip to share for today before give you some tip everyone ha their own allergy and problem including different condition please make sure that these are tip not prescription did you know that you can get shining skin from home without spending to dermatologist these are the secret tip from the staff of dermatology when spring come your skin condition change so you need to change your daily routine amp x200b exfoliation lha cleansing we all already know about aha and bha cleanser now it time for lha cleanser lha ha the smallest particle therefore there is le irritation for those who have sensitive and acne skin can also use it it will make your skin smooth and shine amp x200b moisturizing after you finish cleansing gently wrap your skin with the tower the moisture inside your skin quickly fly out to the air so you need to moisture it right away use highly moisturizing product such a serumkind deep antarctic drop or innisfree green tea seed serum cream amp x200b sunscreen during spring the ultraviolet ray are 5times stronger than when it is fall sunscreen is must have item for skincare it is recommended to apply every time you go out and reapply every hour don forget to check pa and spf when you buy the product in spring spf pa or higher is recommended amp x200b well hope these tip are helpful and hope you all have wonderful spring skincare routine

Makeup,"Best natural looking single lashes?I LOVEEE full lashes but I like them to look natural, usually people can't really tell that I'm wearing falsies. 

I've been looking for single lashes that don't look too dramatic. I prefer the single ones because they are easier to apply and sometimes I just use them to fix some sparse spots.

The ones I normally buy are cheap single lashes by Essence, but I'm willing to spend a bit more if they're worth it!

Makeup,"Worried about engagement photos; did I use the wrong foundation or is it just lighting?Not sure if this is the right place for this, but long story short, I don’t usually wear makeup but I decided to do my own makeup for my engagement shoot since I had a couple breakouts on my face. I tested the foundation once and it looked to be a perfect match, and it looked great when I was putting it on before the photoshoot. I checked my car mirror before we started the shoot and to my horror, it looked darker and pinker than when I initially put it on. It looked like a different color than my neck. I wasn’t able to do anything about it at that point but now I’m just worried how the photos turned out. The thing is, when I took a selfie, it looked like the color matched me perfectly. Will the difference in color show in pictures? Do car mirrors just warp your foundation color in some weird way?? I’m just really stressed about it and wanna hear yalls thoughts

Makeup,"I want to wear makeup but I feel like I don’t look good with itI’m 20 years old and I’ve always wanted to walk outside my house with makeup on. But the issue for me is that I have baby face. 

I look really young for my age. I feel that whenever I put makeup on I look like a child who used their mom’s makeup. I definitely lean more towards the natural side of makeup only because if I do anything else, I feel uncomfortable. 

I know how to apply makeup it’s just I don’t have the confidence to wear it out my house. I never have makeup on. Not even a little bit. Not even for occasions. But it definitely would feel nice to wear it once in a while outside.

So my question is, what can I do to help my confidence? And/or what can I do makeup wise that will help flatter my age?

Any advice is greatly appreciated :)","['want', 'to', 'wear', 'makeup', 'but', 'feel', 'like', 'don', 'look', 'good', 'with', 'itI', 'years', 'old', 'and', 've', 'always', 'wanted', 'to', 'walk', 'outside', 'my', 'house', 'with', 'makeup', 'on', 'But', 'the', 'issue', 'for', 'me', 'is', 'that', 'have', 'baby', 'face', 'look', 'really', 'young', 'for', 'my', 'age', 'feel', 'that', 'whenever', 'put', 'makeup', 'on', 'look', 'like', 'child', 'who', 'used', 'their', 'mom', 'makeup', 'definitely', 'lean', 'more', 'towards', 'the', 'natural', 'side', 'of', 'makeup', 'only', 'because', 'if', 'do', 'anything', 'else', 'feel', 'uncomfortable', 'know', 'how', 'to', 'apply', 'makeup', 'it', 'just', 'don', 'have', 'the', 'confidence', 'to', 'wear', 'it', 'out', 'my', 'house', 'never', 'have', 'makeup', 'on', 'Not', 'even', 'little', 'bit', 'Not', 'even', 'for', 'occasions', 'But', 'it', 'definitely', 'would', 'feel', 'nice', 'to', 'wear', 'it', 'once', 'in', 'while', 'outside', 'So', 'my', 'question', 'is', 'what', 'can', 'do', 'to', 'help', 'my', 'confidence', 'And', 'or', 'what', 'can', 'do', 'makeup', 'wise', 'that', 'will', 'help', 'flatter', 'my', 'age', 'Any', 'advice', 'is', 'greatly', 'appreciated']",want to wear makeup but feel like don look good with iti year old and ve always wanted to walk outside my house with makeup on but the issue for me is that have baby face look really young for my age feel that whenever put makeup on look like child who used their mom makeup definitely lean more towards the natural side of makeup only because if do anything else feel uncomfortable know how to apply makeup it just don have the confidence to wear it out my house never have makeup on not even little bit not even for occasion but it definitely would feel nice to wear it once in while outside so my question is what can do to help my confidence and or what can do makeup wise that will help flatter my age any advice is greatly appreciated

Makeup,"Mixing moisturizer with foundation/BB/CC cream? 

Hi Reddit.

Recently I have been getting more into skincare than I have makeup but I have found a couple different tinted moisturizers that match my skin tone fairly well! I also have been going to the tanning bed (I know the risks) &amp; so my tinted moisturizer has become a bit too light on my face at its palest vs when I'm at my darkest.

I was wondering if there's a way that works for you when you are pale vs when you are darker &amp; if you mix your moisturizer with foundation or just a BB/CC cream.

Any suggestions/tips are more than welcome!

Makeup,"Lash extensions!?!?TLDR: Questions listed in bullets at the bottom for people with lash extensions. Pls feel free to answer as few or as many as you like 🙏🙏

Hiyaaa! I've honestly become really interested in eyelash extensions. The idea of having a more natural look with gorgeous lashes to start the day is super appealing &amp; I LOVE how it can look when done in the particular styles I like. However I worry I won't be able to do much more with my makeup if I get extensions. I like wearing different styles of falsies when I go out and enjoy experimenting with different eye/liner looks too. Would lash extensions make that difficult?
Ig I have a few other questions for lash extension people:

- Is it hard to dust off shadow fallout from your extensions?
- Is it hard to clean off your eye makeup with extensions? 
- Is it hard to put in contacts? 
- Did you have to change the way you wash your face?
- How easily do the extensions fall off? 
- Can you swim in lash extensions? 
- Are you able to use mascara with them or can no product touch the extensions at all? 
- If your natural lashes are pretty flat without curling, will the lash extensions also lay flat, can you curl them, or does it change the angle of your lashes when you get extensions? 
- Follow up, if you can't curl your lashes and have straight lashes, can you laminate your lashes + lash extensions? 
- Do they look weird once they start fall off? 
- How long did they last on you? 
- Would you recommend it?","['Lash', 'extensions', 'TLDR', 'Questions', 'listed', 'in', 'bullets', 'at', 'the', 'bottom', 'for', 'people', 'with', 'lash', 'extensions', 'Pls', 'feel', 'free', 'to', 'answer', 'as', 'few', 'or', 'as', 'many', 'as', 'you', 'like', 'Hiyaaa', 've', 'honestly', 'become', 'really', 'interested', 'in', 'eyelash', 'extensions', 'The', 'idea', 'of', 'having', 'more', 'natural', 'look', 'with', 'gorgeous', 'lashes', 'to', 'start', 'the', 'day', 'is', 'super', 'appealing', 'amp', 'LOVE', 'how', 'it', 'can', 'look', 'when', 'done', 'in', 'the', 'particular', 'styles', 'like', 'However', 'worry', 'won', 'be', 'able', 'to', 'do', 'much', 'more', 'with', 'my', 'makeup', 'if', 'get', 'extensions', 'like', 'wearing', 'different', 'styles', 'of', 'falsies', 'when', 'go', 'out', 'and', 'enjoy', 'experimenting', 'with', 'different', 'eye', 'liner', 'looks', 'too', 'Would', 'lash', 'extensions', 'make', 'that', 'difficult', 'Ig', 'have', 'few', 'other', 'questions', 'for', 'lash', 'extension', 'people', 'Is', 'it', 'hard', 'to', 'dust', 'off', 'shadow', 'fallout', 'from', 'your', 'extensions', 'Is', 'it', 'hard', 'to', 'clean', 'off', 'your', 'eye', 'makeup', 'with', 'extensions', 'Is', 'it', 'hard', 'to', 'put', 'in', 'contacts', 'Did', 'you', 'have', 'to', 'change', 'the', 'way', 'you', 'wash', 'your', 'face', 'How', 'easily', 'do', 'the', 'extensions', 'fall', 'off', 'Can', 'you', 'swim', 'in', 'lash', 'extensions', 'Are', 'you', 'able', 'to', 'use', 'mascara', 'with', 'them', 'or', 'can', 'no', 'product', 'touch', 'the', 'extensions', 'at', 'all', 'If', 'your', 'natural', 'lashes', 'are', 'pretty', 'flat', 'without', 'curling', 'will', 'the', 'lash', 'extensions', 'also', 'lay', 'flat', 'can', 'you', 'curl', 'them', 'or', 'does', 'it', 'change', 'the', 'angle', 'of', 'your', 'lashes', 'when', 'you', 'get', 'extensions', 'Follow', 'up', 'if', 'you', 'can', 'curl', 'your', 'lashes', 'and', 'have', 'straight', 'lashes', 'can', 'you', 'laminate', 'your', 'lashes', 'lash', 'extensions', 'Do', 'they', 'look', 'weird', 'once', 'they', 'start', 'fall', 'off', 'How', 'long', 'did', 'they', 'last', 'on', 'you', 'Would', 'you', 'recommend', 'it']",lash extension tldr questions listed in bullet at the bottom for people with lash extension pls feel free to answer a few or a many a you like hiyaaa ve honestly become really interested in eyelash extension the idea of having more natural look with gorgeous lash to start the day is super appealing amp love how it can look when done in the particular style like however worry won be able to do much more with my makeup if get extension like wearing different style of falsie when go out and enjoy experimenting with different eye liner look too would lash extension make that difficult ig have few other question for lash extension people is it hard to dust off shadow fallout from your extension is it hard to clean off your eye makeup with extension is it hard to put in contact did you have to change the way you wash your face how easily do the extension fall off can you swim in lash extension are you able to use mascara with them or can no product touch the extension at all if your natural lash are pretty flat without curling will the lash extension also lay flat can you curl them or doe it change the angle of your lash when you get extension follow up if you can curl your lash and have straight lash can you laminate your lash lash extension do they look weird once they start fall off how long did they last on you would you recommend it

Makeup,"Lip products that don't taste/feel bad?Hello! I am rediscovering my love for lip colors and I am very excited about it. It's pretty much the only sort of makeup I will actually wear - I like my lips and want them to be juicy lol.

Feel free to recommend different price points: Budget, mid-range, high-end (probably won't go for them but one can dream) 

I have tried some Elf colored balms and I like them but they have a taste I'm not super fond of. 

I recently got a Roen liquid lip balm in a very lovely color and finish, but it's minty and kind of painful?

Makeup,"L’Oréal Infallible Liquid FoundationI keep seeing it on TikTok and was highly skeptical because usually over-advertised products aren’t worth the hype for me.
Basically I ended up getting the powder foundation because my current Maybelline FitMe ran out, then was out of stock at the store I went to and I needed something fast, so I bit the bullet and tried the L’Oréal Infallible powder foundation.

Makeup,"At 33, I’m not sure where to start with foundation.Hello everyone! 

As the title says, I’m a little overwhelmed by all the options out there. I’m a 33 year old woman. I’ve never really worn a lot of makeup - I fill my eyebrows everyday, and sometimes curl my eyelashes and wear mascara. If I’m going out, I also wear eye shadow, and a bit of blush. That’s about the extent of it. 

That said, over the last 4 years I’ve had 2 babies and it’s showing on my face. My wrinkles are a little more obvious, my eye circles a little darker and (worst of all!) I have a not-so-subtle « sun mustache ». I’m starting to feel like I would benefit from wearing foundation to even out my skin tone, but I’m concerned because I don’t want to ALSO need to contour and use blush and everything else. I want a foundation that will still allow my freckles to show - kind of like Megan Markle. Would anyone have any suggestions?

Thank you 😊","['At', 'not', 'sure', 'where', 'to', 'start', 'with', 'foundation', 'Hello', 'everyone', 'As', 'the', 'title', 'says', 'little', 'overwhelmed', 'by', 'all', 'the', 'options', 'out', 'there', 'year', 'old', 'woman', 've', 'never', 'really', 'worn', 'lot', 'of', 'makeup', 'fill', 'my', 'eyebrows', 'everyday', 'and', 'sometimes', 'curl', 'my', 'eyelashes', 'and', 'wear', 'mascara', 'If', 'going', 'out', 'also', 'wear', 'eye', 'shadow', 'and', 'bit', 'of', 'blush', 'That', 'about', 'the', 'extent', 'of', 'it', 'That', 'said', 'over', 'the', 'last', 'years', 've', 'had', 'babies', 'and', 'it', 'showing', 'on', 'my', 'face', 'My', 'wrinkles', 'are', 'little', 'more', 'obvious', 'my', 'eye', 'circles', 'little', 'darker', 'and', 'worst', 'of', 'all', 'have', 'not', 'so', 'subtle', 'sun', 'mustache', 'starting', 'to', 'feel', 'like', 'would', 'benefit', 'from', 'wearing', 'foundation', 'to', 'even', 'out', 'my', 'skin', 'tone', 'but', 'concerned', 'because', 'don', 'want', 'to', 'ALSO', 'need', 'to', 'contour', 'and', 'use', 'blush', 'and', 'everything', 'else', 'want', 'foundation', 'that', 'will', 'still', 'allow', 'my', 'freckles', 'to', 'show', 'kind', 'of', 'like', 'Megan', 'Markle', 'Would', 'anyone', 'have', 'any', 'suggestions', 'Thank', 'you']",at not sure where to start with foundation hello everyone as the title say little overwhelmed by all the option out there year old woman ve never really worn lot of makeup fill my eyebrow everyday and sometimes curl my eyelash and wear mascara if going out also wear eye shadow and bit of blush that about the extent of it that said over the last year ve had baby and it showing on my face my wrinkle are little more obvious my eye circle little darker and worst of all have not so subtle sun mustache starting to feel like would benefit from wearing foundation to even out my skin tone but concerned because don want to also need to contour and use blush and everything else want foundation that will still allow my freckle to show kind of like megan markle would anyone have any suggestion thank you
Makeup,MAC foundationAnyone use MAC foundation? I just purchased some (although in a slightly new shade as my previous stuff was a little tinted orange for me lol). I’ve used it several times and every times it’s like it’s not even there and not in a good way. It doesn’t cover anything (acne scars/blemishes) I find myself reapplying 3x a day to try to cover my face and it’s like it doesn’t work. I spent $35 on it and really hate to waste it and was wondering if anyone else has this same issue,"['MAC', 'foundationAnyone', 'use', 'MAC', 'foundation', 'just', 'purchased', 'some', 'although', 'in', 'slightly', 'new', 'shade', 'as', 'my', 'previous', 'stuff', 'was', 'little', 'tinted', 'orange', 'for', 'me', 'lol', 've', 'used', 'it', 'several', 'times', 'and', 'every', 'times', 'it', 'like', 'it', 'not', 'even', 'there', 'and', 'not', 'in', 'good', 'way', 'It', 'doesn', 'cover', 'anything', 'acne', 'scars', 'blemishes', 'find', 'myself', 'reapplying', '3x', 'day', 'to', 'try', 'to', 'cover', 'my', 'face', 'and', 'it', 'like', 'it', 'doesn', 'work', 'spent', 'on', 'it', 'and', 'really', 'hate', 'to', 'waste', 'it', 'and', 'was', 'wondering', 'if', 'anyone', 'else', 'has', 'this', 'same', 'issue']",mac foundationanyone use mac foundation just purchased some although in slightly new shade a my previous stuff wa little tinted orange for me lol ve used it several time and every time it like it not even there and not in good way it doesn cover anything acne scar blemish find myself reapplying 3x day to try to cover my face and it like it doesn work spent on it and really hate to waste it and wa wondering if anyone else ha this same issue
Makeup,"Which Laura Mercier tinted moisturizer? Or other recommendationsI know the reformulation of the Laura Mercier tinted moisturizer got a lot of negative reviews. I tried some on in Ulta today, and I thought it was okay but am not sure if the oil-free or natural formulation is better. My skin is fairly dry due to tretinoin, but I also hate the dewy look on me. Some matte foundations I've tried have just made the dryness and lines (over 40 here) look worse. 

I've also seen NARS Pure Radiant Tint recommended instead. I tried it, and it looked fine at first but was super shiny a few hours later. I don't know if a primer might help prevent the shine.

Thoughts on which LM tint would be better? 3N1 is a good color for me as a muted warm olive. Anything else I should look at? My options are limited as my face hates hyaluronic acid, and it's in so many products these days.","['Which', 'Laura', 'Mercier', 'tinted', 'moisturizer', 'Or', 'other', 'recommendationsI', 'know', 'the', 'reformulation', 'of', 'the', 'Laura', 'Mercier', 'tinted', 'moisturizer', 'got', 'lot', 'of', 'negative', 'reviews', 'tried', 'some', 'on', 'in', 'Ulta', 'today', 'and', 'thought', 'it', 'was', 'okay', 'but', 'am', 'not', 'sure', 'if', 'the', 'oil', 'free', 'or', 'natural', 'formulation', 'is', 'better', 'My', 'skin', 'is', 'fairly', 'dry', 'due', 'to', 'tretinoin', 'but', 'also', 'hate', 'the', 'dewy', 'look', 'on', 'me', 'Some', 'matte', 'foundations', 've', 'tried', 'have', 'just', 'made', 'the', 'dryness', 'and', 'lines', 'over', 'here', 'look', 'worse', 've', 'also', 'seen', 'NARS', 'Pure', 'Radiant', 'Tint', 'recommended', 'instead', 'tried', 'it', 'and', 'it', 'looked', 'fine', 'at', 'first', 'but', 'was', 'super', 'shiny', 'few', 'hours', 'later', 'don', 'know', 'if', 'primer', 'might', 'help', 'prevent', 'the', 'shine', 'Thoughts', 'on', 'which', 'LM', 'tint', 'would', 'be', 'better', '3N', 'is', 'good', 'color', 'for', 'me', 'as', 'muted', 'warm', 'olive', 'Anything', 'else', 'should', 'look', 'at', 'My', 'options', 'are', 'limited', 'as', 'my', 'face', 'hates', 'hyaluronic', 'acid', 'and', 'it', 'in', 'so', 'many', 'products', 'these', 'days']",which laura mercier tinted moisturizer or other recommendationsi know the reformulation of the laura mercier tinted moisturizer got lot of negative review tried some on in ulta today and thought it wa okay but am not sure if the oil free or natural formulation is better my skin is fairly dry due to tretinoin but also hate the dewy look on me some matte foundation ve tried have just made the dryness and line over here look worse ve also seen nars pure radiant tint recommended instead tried it and it looked fine at first but wa super shiny few hour later don know if primer might help prevent the shine thoughts on which lm tint would be better 3n is good color for me a muted warm olive anything else should look at my option are limited a my face hate hyaluronic acid and it in so many product these day
Makeup,"Follow Up: Tell me about your HG Foundation&lt;Mods if this is not allowed please delete&gt;

Wanted to post a follow up for all you wonderful people who helped me when I asked for foundation recommendations: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Makeup/comments/ti9doj/tell\_me\_all\_about\_your\_hg\_foundation/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Makeup/comments/ti9doj/tell_me_all_about_your_hg_foundation/)

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks to everyone who responded - it has been a wild ride that’s for sure. 

I will not buy the lede - the winner is **Giorgio Armani Silk in 5.75**. To quickly recap, I have dry skin and needed a new foundation. However, I have olive skin so it made color matching a bit harder. (I've never worn MAC so idk my color in their system but I am definitely warm and definitely olive)

I kind of treated it like a bracket, and yesterday I swatched the final 2 contenders to declare the winner. Over the course of the week or so, I visited Nordstrom, Neiman Marcus, Sephora, Target and Ulta.

&amp;#x200B;

I was very up front with every sales person I encountered, and gave more or less this exact spiel - *I am on a recon mission, I will not be buying today but I aim to buy ASAP, I want to sample a foundation at home on top of my sunscreen using my normal morning routine to see how it performs, and I will be purchasing the winner hopefully by the end of the week.* 

Most salespeople were terrible at color matching compared to me trying to find my own match, except 1 woman at Sephora. I don't hold that against them though, cause I see my face multiple times every single day, so it stands to reason I have a better idea of what suits me. Here's everything I tried, in alphabetical order:

&amp;#x200B;

* Armani Power Fabric 6.0 - too deep *(matched by a Nordstrom salesperson)*
* Armani Silk 6.0 - too deep *(matched by a Nordstrom salesperson)* It is incredibly annoying that these 2 Armani shades in 6.0 were so different to each other. Power Fabric was deeper and cooler even though they were both 6.0
* Chanel Les Beiges 30 - too pink, no options warm enough *(matched by a Nordstrom salesperson)*
* Chanel Sublimage 60 - too deep *(matched by a different Nordstrom salesperson, terrible experience, didn't even want to try this foundation and she told me the Chanel one I was after was ""bullshit"")*
* Dior Forever Matte 2WO - *(matched by a Nordstrom salesperson)* not bad! Decent color match but transfers very easily, so I am not in love with the formula
* ELF Camo CC Cream Light 240W - not bad but I didn’t move forward with it, forgot why
* Estee Lauder DW 2w2 - too deep, iirc
* Estee Lauder Futurist Hydra 1w2  - not bad! Runner up
* Estée Lauder Double Wear 3W1 - too deep *(matched by a Nordstrom salesperson)*
* Estée Lauder Double Wear 2W1 - better than 3W1 but too pink 
* Estée Lauder Double Wear 2W2 - too deep 
* Fenty Pro Filt’r 145 - ever so slightly too yellow, and 140 was too light. I so desperately wanted Fenty to work, but not enough to buy 2 shades and mix my own
* Fenty Pro Filt’r 290 - good tone, but too deep
* Gucci 250O - too yellow
* IT Cosmetics in Light (I think the Ulta-exclusive one but I am not 100% sure) - side note, it’s infuriating that the shade “Light” is different across all their foundation products, some are cool toned and some are warm toned. And I think they need to name their products a little better, I was confused especially since the packaging is so similar across the board . I appreciate the Estee Lauder shade nomenclature (where 2W1 = depth-tone-level), very easy to navigate.
* Kosas - 160 too light
* Kosas - 210 ever so slightly too deep. This could've been a runner up but I felt the texture was too thick for my liking
* Kosas 270 - too deep (tried this before the 210)
* Lancome Teint Idole Ultra Wear 280W Bisque - too pink
* Loreal Infallible 420 - too light
* Maybelline Dewy &amp; Smooth 118 - too pink
* Maybelline Super Stay Active Wear 220 - too deep
* MUFE Forever HD 2y20 - too pink
* Nars Radiant Longwear Deauville Light 4 - too light
* Nars Tinted Moisturizer Norwich Light 1.5 - too light
* NYX Can’t Stop Won’t Stop in Nude - not bad! Runner up
* Pat McGrath Labs - No good color match, like at all. So disappointing.
* The Ordinary Coverage Foundation 2.0 YG - not bad! Would’ve moved forward but I read questionable reviews and wasn’t sure the formula was right for me.

IMPORTANT NOTE: Anything that says too light or too deep - this means I couldn’t find the right warm (olive) tone in my depth. For example, the Nars Radiant Longwear was a nice warm color but too light, but if I move one color over to a closer depth, it was the wrong undertone, so then if I move one more to the next it’s now the right tone again but 1-2 shades too deep. Same (but backwards) for anything that says too deep. Similar for anything that says too pink, it means there were no warm options in the right depth.

&amp;#x200B;

Ultimately Armani 5.75 is the answer.

If I had to pick something other than Armani, these are the ones I would revisit:

* Estee Lauder Futurist Hydra
* IT Cosmetics in Light 
* The Ordinary Coverage Foundation, cautiously

These are the ones I was most disappointed about since the shade was so close but not close enough:

* Fenty Pro Filt’r 145
* Gucci 250O
* Kosas - 210
* Pat McGrath Labs - I think mixing 2 colors would work here but not at $68 a pop.

Makeup,"Glossier stretch concealer shades?new to this sub so I’m not sure how everyone feels about Glossier products, but I love cloud paint, boybrow, generation g, and their lipglosses. I already need to reup on these things and I’m considering adding the stretch concealer. 

I’m medium but depending on time of the year and how much sun I’ve gotten can wear warm or more neutral medium shades. Spring is an especially weird time. I’m wondering how “forgiving” these are if the shade isn’t perfectly matched.

Makeup,"Survey about cruelty-free products and beauty communityHey Guys, 

I know some of you might interested in the topic of cruelty-free products. I am looking for volunteers to participate in my survey on “The Influence of Online Communities on the Purchase Behavior of Cruelty-free Products” for a school project. The survey assesses how online communities generate interest about cruelty-free products, and whether or not they influence  the purchase behavior of these products. 

I think this is a topic that might interest a lot of people since it researches the relations of media and cruelty-free products. If you are interested, please fill out the survey. The survey should take around 3-7 minutes to complete. Your participation is fully voluntary and a withdrawal from the survey is possible at any point during its completion. No compensation is offered for participation in this survey, but your participation will be invaluable to my research. If you wish to be informed about the final results of the survey please contact me via e-mail after you complete it.

If you have any questions regarding this experiment, please do not hesitate to contact me (my email address is linked in the form).

Makeup,"Stubborn eyelashes won’t hold curl!First time ever posting! 

I have really long, straight, and light blonde eyelashes that naturally tangle ( maybe because they are soft?) For years I have struggled to find ways to keep them curled all day. I have tried everything. I obviously have an eyelash curler (the tart one). I heat it a little before use, I do the curl up the lash trick. I spend forever curling them bc they take forever to curl in a way that looks nice (they are stubborn!) 

Then I use waterproof mascara (better than sex). I usually end up having to curl them again after applying mascara bc they already start to fall, but then they start to stick to together and look spidery. Then, after all that, a few hours later they will probably start to fall, or be completely straight again! Even in cold weather, so it’s not just because of humidity. 

I guess my question is: what now? Is there anything else I can try? Any tips or products I should look into? I don’t want to rely on extensions or eyelash perm bc of the cost and the maintenance.

Makeup,"Seems like you would be the experts, describe your dream makeup area?I'll start by saying thank you for any info you guys can provide. Also I'm a truck driver who likes to build stuff on the side, so forgive any terms or total cluelessness I show here.

My SIL has been living with us for a while after a bad divorce and is really kicking ass and getting her life better than it was. She is very big into doing her make-up and hair.  She keeps mentioning she wants a good area to get ready and just generally decompress. 
I talked to my wife (who doesn't wear make-up, so is as unsure as I am). And I said I wanted to build her a nice area for it in her room. 

So far my plan is:
My space is about 5 feet long

Obviously tons of light. 

Plugs hidden some where accessible

 a wireless charger built into the top.

Something that won't stain easily and
 cleans well 

She mentioned a chair that, to me,  looks like a director's chair, but the only reason is that it has a back, so alternative chairs with backs?

And things like I plan on it being basically 2 small ""cabinets"" with a top that can be removed, so if she ever decides to move, or we all move as a family again,  we can get this huge thing out.   


ANYHOW back to my question. What things would really make an excellent space for you all? Drawers vs cabinets? Big and deep for like blow driers and stuff? Small skinny ones? How many plugs is enough? 

I'd love if you could link pictures then point out specifics of possible. Like I said, I'm just a dumb truck driver🤣

Makeup,"Help me find my fave beauty sponge?I once bought a cheap beauty sponge in a pinch from Target and it's finally fallen apart and I cannot find it again!! 

In either late Fall 2019 or maybe January 2020 I was on a work trip to Nashville. I realized I forgot to pack my beauty blender so went to Target and grabbed one for under $10. It was turquoise. Rounded bottom. Hourglass shape. The top had a flat side. I loved it more than my beauty blender and I used it until it fell apart.

It was similar to this turquoise one: [https://www.amazon.com/l-f-Blending-Sponge-Latex-Free-85097/dp/B079HTFZR7](https://www.amazon.com/l-f-Blending-Sponge-Latex-Free-85097/dp/B079HTFZR7) in terms of the rounded bottom, hourglass shape, and colour, but this one is missing the flat edge.  
This one has the flat top but is missing the rounded bottom: [https://www.target.com/p/e-l-f-highlighting-blending-sponge/-/A-52504348#lnk=sametab](https://www.target.com/p/e-l-f-highlighting-blending-sponge/-/A-52504348#lnk=sametab) 

I've been through every sponge Target sells online and can't find a match. So far, e.l.f. is the closest match but I'm thinking maybe it was in a shape they no longer make BUT DOES ANYONE KNOW? Anyone remember what beauty sponges target was selling 2+ years ago? That's a normal thing for someone to keep track of, right? Is this the dumbest thing I've ever tried to crowdsource?

Makeup,"How to regrow eyebrows without being eyebrowless?I have been drawing my eyebrows on for awhile and though I like the look (I make them crescents which is definitely not natural) I want to gradually decrease the amount of makeup I wear. Eventually I want to go makeup-less and for that I will need eyebrows. 

I *hate* the feathered look and the arched look, which is why I started drawing them. I also like having really dark pronounced eyebrows, so whatever I use has to be bold. 

I tried doing eyebrow “stamps” where I put a stencil and “stamp” the color into it but it wasn’t at all as dark as I wanted and came off too easily.

Makeup,"Lighter brown liquid eyeliner helpI am looking for a liquid eyeliner in a lighter brown shade. I have shopped around and it seems like the ones I've tried are all too dark on me. Preferably waterproof, but if it's long lasting it doesn't have to be.

NYX Epic and Milani browns are too dark, so anything espresso or deep brown is probably out.

Makeup,"What are your tips for a make up novice?I'm 23F and I've been wearing make up since high school, but I was never very good at it. Always just did the basics: mascara, a little lip gloss, and some foundation to cover up the redness in my cheeks and nose.

Makeup,"Should I even try to conceal dry acne spots?I'm sure a lot of us have experienced this. Sometimes I don't even touch my acne and it gets super dry and flaky. Going over it with concealer, even after moisturizing, just clings to the dry parts and looks horrible.

Do I just not put concealer there and live with the redness? Is there something else I should be doing? I try not to scrub my skin unless I have to, because it *all* dries out and looks like that. Also scrubbing those areas makes them raw and they really sting.

Thanks!","['Should', 'even', 'try', 'to', 'conceal', 'dry', 'acne', 'spots', 'sure', 'lot', 'of', 'us', 'have', 'experienced', 'this', 'Sometimes', 'don', 'even', 'touch', 'my', 'acne', 'and', 'it', 'gets', 'super', 'dry', 'and', 'flaky', 'Going', 'over', 'it', 'with', 'concealer', 'even', 'after', 'moisturizing', 'just', 'clings', 'to', 'the', 'dry', 'parts', 'and', 'looks', 'horrible', 'Do', 'just', 'not', 'put', 'concealer', 'there', 'and', 'live', 'with', 'the', 'redness', 'Is', 'there', 'something', 'else', 'should', 'be', 'doing', 'try', 'not', 'to', 'scrub', 'my', 'skin', 'unless', 'have', 'to', 'because', 'it', 'all', 'dries', 'out', 'and', 'looks', 'like', 'that', 'Also', 'scrubbing', 'those', 'areas', 'makes', 'them', 'raw', 'and', 'they', 'really', 'sting', 'Thanks']",should even try to conceal dry acne spot sure lot of u have experienced this sometimes don even touch my acne and it get super dry and flaky going over it with concealer even after moisturizing just cling to the dry part and look horrible do just not put concealer there and live with the redness is there something else should be doing try not to scrub my skin unless have to because it all dry out and look like that also scrubbing those area make them raw and they really sting thanks

Makeup,"Help please: No matter what I do, my skin always looks flat matte when I’m trying to achieve a dewy/glowy look.I work in cosmetics so I have to wear a full face every day. Since masks are now off, I have to pay a lot more attention to my complexion than I have for the last two years. I love a glowy/dewy/glass skin/just-make-me-look-like-I-bathe-in-oil-pls look, but it feels like no matter what I do, my skin looks nothing but matte. I’m 23F, dry-combo skin, I tailor my skincare around my skin goals of course, and I thoroughly hydrate my skin as well as drinking a ton of water, but my skin always looks as dry as the Sahara even though I’m wearing ALL glowy products (will list below). I was complaining about it to my coworker today and she said “wow, yeah, honestly it looks like you TRIED to be matte”. Any advice or recommendations would help me out a ton because I’m going insane. I’ll buy any product, I’m desperate lmao. I’ll list my skincare routine in the replies so I don’t clutter up the main post as much.

My current complexion products (obvi not including my AM skincare routine) are:
-Supergoop glow SPF
-MAC radiance primer mixed with a little Strobe Cream
-NARS Radiant Creamy concealer (undereyes only)
-Dior Forever Glow foundation OR MAC Studio Radiance foundation if I’m having a good skin day and want less coverage. If it matters, I apply with a Beautyblender.
-LIGHT dusting of Hourglass ambient lighting powder (I can’t skip powder under my eyes, and I lightly dust my cheeks when using powder blush/highlight. I also dust my forehead because I have bangs)
-MAC Fix+ Magic Radiance setting spray (My other coworker literally wears a matte foundation and uses this setting spray and her skin becomes so perfectly dewy that I asked what her highlighter was and she said she wasn’t wearing any, it’s just from the setting spray. I wanted to cry.)

Makeup,"How do I level up my makeup?Hi everyone,

&amp;#x200B;

I'm somewhat of a beginner to makeup and have been experimenting with new products and styles. Currently my go-to routine is to use some The Ordinary Moisturiser on my chin, neck, and undereyes, Morphe foundation on top of these areas (these are the darkest areas on my face, or the places which have blemishes). I then use a Morphe Eyeliner Colour Pencil (I think in the shade Trendsetter) to do some eyelinger on the outer end of my bottom lid, continue it outwards to do a wing, and then connect it with my top lid and fill it in. I'll then go futher inwards on my top lid to get the eyeliner just above my eye, not just at the ends of my eye. Then I go in with mascara on the top and bottom lashes. I'll then put lip balm on my lips, and some sort of liquid lip or lipstick over the top. (Sorry for the terrible description, this is the first time I've ever described what I do:/). Sometimes I'll do blush or eyeshadow as well (super basic, just something shimmery or very light coloured eyeshadow) if I have time. 

It kind of looks like this at the moment (random video found on the internet, time 3:13): [https://youtu.be/CC-Domq\_Asw?t=193](https://youtu.be/CC-Domq_Asw?t=193)

I'm trying to figure out how to get my makeup to look like this: [https://i.redd.it/scy7vxn5zpp81.jpg](https://i.redd.it/scy7vxn5zpp81.jpg)

It's super glam and sharp and sooo beautiful. How would I get it to this level? Is anyone experienced in this level of makeup able to tell me how long it would take to do this amount of makeup before going out? Should I be putting foundation over my entire face (I don't at the moment because my face is dry and it gets cracked/textured - which is why I use moisturiser under my foundation at the moment - so should I find a good primer too, and if so, any recommendations?)? Should I be using false eyelashes, and if so, wouldn't that damage my eyelashes? Would a lip plumper damage my lips? Anything else I should add to my routine?

Thank you so much for all the advice in advance!","['How', 'do', 'level', 'up', 'my', 'makeup', 'Hi', 'everyone', 'amp', 'x200B', 'somewhat', 'of', 'beginner', 'to', 'makeup', 'and', 'have', 'been', 'experimenting', 'with', 'new', 'products', 'and', 'styles', 'Currently', 'my', 'go', 'to', 'routine', 'is', 'to', 'use', 'some', 'The', 'Ordinary', 'Moisturiser', 'on', 'my', 'chin', 'neck', 'and', 'undereyes', 'Morphe', 'foundation', 'on', 'top', 'of', 'these', 'areas', 'these', 'are', 'the', 'darkest', 'areas', 'on', 'my', 'face', 'or', 'the', 'places', 'which', 'have', 'blemishes', 'then', 'use', 'Morphe', 'Eyeliner', 'Colour', 'Pencil', 'think', 'in', 'the', 'shade', 'Trendsetter', 'to', 'do', 'some', 'eyelinger', 'on', 'the', 'outer', 'end', 'of', 'my', 'bottom', 'lid', 'continue', 'it', 'outwards', 'to', 'do', 'wing', 'and', 'then', 'connect', 'it', 'with', 'my', 'top', 'lid', 'and', 'fill', 'it', 'in', 'll', 'then', 'go', 'futher', 'inwards', 'on', 'my', 'top', 'lid', 'to', 'get', 'the', 'eyeliner', 'just', 'above', 'my', 'eye', 'not', 'just', 'at', 'the', 'ends', 'of', 'my', 'eye', 'Then', 'go', 'in', 'with', 'mascara', 'on', 'the', 'top', 'and', 'bottom', 'lashes', 'll', 'then', 'put', 'lip', 'balm', 'on', 'my', 'lips', 'and', 'some', 'sort', 'of', 'liquid', 'lip', 'or', 'lipstick', 'over', 'the', 'top', 'Sorry', 'for', 'the', 'terrible', 'description', 'this', 'is', 'the', 'first', 'time', 've', 'ever', 'described', 'what', 'do', 'Sometimes', 'll', 'do', 'blush', 'or', 'eyeshadow', 'as', 'well', 'super', 'basic', 'just', 'something', 'shimmery', 'or', 'very', 'light', 'coloured', 'eyeshadow', 'if', 'have', 'time', 'It', 'kind', 'of', 'looks', 'like', 'this', 'at', 'the', 'moment', 'random', 'video', 'found', 'on', 'the', 'internet', 'time', 'https', 'youtu', 'be', 'CC', 'Domq', '_Asw', 'https', 'youtu', 'be', 'CC', 'Domq_Asw', 'trying', 'to', 'figure', 'out', 'how', 'to', 'get', 'my', 'makeup', 'to', 'look', 'like', 'this', 'https', 'redd', 'it', 'scy7vxn5zpp', 'jpg', 'https', 'redd', 'it', 'scy7vxn5zpp', 'jpg', 'It', 'super', 'glam', 'and', 'sharp', 'and', 'sooo', 'beautiful', 'How', 'would', 'get', 'it', 'to', 'this', 'level', 'Is', 'anyone', 'experienced', 'in', 'this', 'level', 'of', 'makeup', 'able', 'to', 'tell', 'me', 'how', 'long', 'it', 'would', 'take', 'to', 'do', 'this', 'amount', 'of', 'makeup', 'before', 'going', 'out', 'Should', 'be', 'putting', 'foundation', 'over', 'my', 'entire', 'face', 'don', 'at', 'the', 'moment', 'because', 'my', 'face', 'is', 'dry', 'and', 'it', 'gets', 'cracked', 'textured', 'which', 'is', 'why', 'use', 'moisturiser', 'under', 'my', 'foundation', 'at', 'the', 'moment', 'so', 'should', 'find', 'good', 'primer', 'too', 'and', 'if', 'so', 'any', 'recommendations', 'Should', 'be', 'using', 'false', 'eyelashes', 'and', 'if', 'so', 'wouldn', 'that', 'damage', 'my', 'eyelashes', 'Would', 'lip', 'plumper', 'damage', 'my', 'lips', 'Anything', 'else', 'should', 'add', 'to', 'my', 'routine', 'Thank', 'you', 'so', 'much', 'for', 'all', 'the', 'advice', 'in', 'advance']",how do level up my makeup hi everyone amp x200b somewhat of beginner to makeup and have been experimenting with new product and style currently my go to routine is to use some the ordinary moisturiser on my chin neck and undereyes morphe foundation on top of these area these are the darkest area on my face or the place which have blemish then use morphe eyeliner colour pencil think in the shade trendsetter to do some eyelinger on the outer end of my bottom lid continue it outwards to do wing and then connect it with my top lid and fill it in ll then go futher inwards on my top lid to get the eyeliner just above my eye not just at the end of my eye then go in with mascara on the top and bottom lash ll then put lip balm on my lip and some sort of liquid lip or lipstick over the top sorry for the terrible description this is the first time ve ever described what do sometimes ll do blush or eyeshadow a well super basic just something shimmery or very light coloured eyeshadow if have time it kind of look like this at the moment random video found on the internet time http youtu be cc domq _asw http youtu be cc domq_asw trying to figure out how to get my makeup to look like this http redd it scy7vxn5zpp jpg http redd it scy7vxn5zpp jpg it super glam and sharp and sooo beautiful how would get it to this level is anyone experienced in this level of makeup able to tell me how long it would take to do this amount of makeup before going out should be putting foundation over my entire face don at the moment because my face is dry and it get cracked textured which is why use moisturiser under my foundation at the moment so should find good primer too and if so any recommendation should be using false eyelash and if so wouldn that damage my eyelash would lip plumper damage my lip anything else should add to my routine thank you so much for all the advice in advance

......

🔎 REVIEW: 


🔸️PATCHINESS: no patchiness 


🔸️BLENDABILITY: very easy to blend out 


🔸️KICK-BACK/FALL-OUT: 


+ experienced kick-back in all shades used 


+ experienced fall-out, the most being from matte shade 'Yacht Life' 


🔸️COLOR-STORY CRITIQUE: 


+ this palette inholds the nice 'light-to-dark' gradient that I always look for. The included shades range from light to midtone to deep. There are quite a few options available to create depth in your look, which drastically improves a palette's versatility (i.e., the types/amount of varying looks you can create). 


+ there are many neutral 'transition shades' included in this particular color-story. 


+ the formula balance ratio in this palette is 19:16 (mattes to non-mattes), &amp; I think a 54% / 46% formula split is fairly balanced, &amp; provides enough range-of-use. 


+ I classify this as a mix-toned (neutral and bold) palette, &amp; I don't have another palette like this in my collection. 


+ there is NOT a matte black in this palette, which I always prefer - as it deems any palette truly 'universal'. 


+ throughout exploring this entire palette, I didn't encounter any 'dud' shades. 


🔸️FORMULA EVALUATION: 

//

+ | MATTES |: 

• each one is soft, and maintains the same consistency across the palette

• they are perfect for creating gradients 

• layering them is almost impossible 

• they are absolutely true-to-tone

• it was difficult to build them up to reach their maximum potential 

• this is a more 'buildable' formula (in lieu of being 'directly pigmented'), making it easier to manage and control the formula

//

+ | SHIMMERS |: 

• these shimmers are very hard-pressed

• each one has a base pigment, making them multifunctional 

• these shimmers require building for great outcome

• works perfectly well with a dry brush, works even better with a dampened brush

......

🔸️PACKAGING: 


+ The exterior cover design/art matches the interior color-story quite well, and is on-theme with the palette's name. 


+ I think this packaging is a great representation of the brand (Morphe), as it's inline with several other products in this range.

......

🔸️RECOMMENDATION: I know this eye look is kind of weird, but I really wanted to create something that would capture the entire essence of this palette. I wanted to combine the blues, pinks, and neutrals in some way. I'm not entirely crazed about Morphe palettes, but some of them are actually really intriguing. I preferred the color selection in here, and I appreciate all the similar tones, making it very easy to create gradients. There's a hell-of-a-lot of looks to be done with this palette, and when I look at it - I just get fully inspired! 

......

▪️FINAL CONCLUSION: (recommend)

+ very easy to work with

+ amount of blend-out shades

+ multiple angles of depth

......

+ Favorite Shade: Windsurf

- Least Favorite Shade: Lazy Days

......

🚦 RATING: A

......

⭐ RATING LEGEND:

A = totally wow'd me

B = not the best, but I like it

C = personal bias, nothing wrong w/ product

D = this didn't work out for me

F = I totally hate this

story critique this palette inholds the nice light to dark gradient that always look for the included shade range from light to midtone to deep there are quite few option available to create depth in your look which drastically improves palette versatility the type amount of varying look you can create there are many neutral transition shade included in this particular color story the formula balance ratio in this palette is matte to non matte amp think formula split is fairly balanced amp provides enough range of use classify this a mix toned neutral and bold palette amp don have another palette like this in my collection there is not matte black in this palette which always prefer a it deems any palette truly universal throughout exploring this entire palette didn encounter any dud shade formula evaluation mattes each one is soft and maintains the same consistency across the palette they are perfect for creating gradient layering them is almost impossible they are absolutely true to tone it wa difficult to build them up to reach their maximum potential this is more buildable formula in lieu of being directly pigmented making it easier to manage and control the formula shimmers these shimmer are very hard pressed each one ha base pigment making them multifunctional these shimmer require building for great outcome work perfectly well with dry brush work even better with dampened brush packaging the exterior cover design art match the interior color story quite well and is on theme with the palette name think this packaging is great representation of the brand morphe a it inline with several other product in this range recommendation know this eye look is kind of weird but really wanted to create something that would capture the entire essence of this palette wanted to combine the blue pink and neutral in some way not entirely crazed about morphe palette but some of them are actually really intriguing preferred the color selection in here and

I think maybe it’s the a combo of my primer + foundation and looking for good combos. I use honest beauty matte primer or milk hydro and Armani luminous silk OR L’Oréal lumi but shape tape cakes on all of these combos. 

Any tips would be appreciated!","['Shape', 'tape', 'pillingHey', 'everyone', 'finally', 'decided', 'to', 'try', 'out', 'shape', 'tape', 'after', 'hearing', 'so', 'many', 'good', 'things', 'about', 'it', 'unfortunately', 'it', 'cakes', 'and', 'rolls', 'off', 'my', 'skin', 'Any', 'idea', 'why', 'or', 'what', 'could', 'be', 'causing', 'this', 'After', 'applying', 'it', 'just', 'cakes', 'and', 'have', 'to', 'drag', 'the', 'makeup', 'out', 'and', 'it', 'just', 'pills', 'think', 'maybe', 'it', 'the', 'combo', 'of', 'my', 'primer', 'foundation', 'and', 'looking', 'for', 'good', 'combos', 'use', 'honest', 'beauty', 'matte', 'primer', 'or', 'milk', 'hydro', 'and', 'Armani', 'luminous', 'silk', 'OR', 'Oréal', 'lumi', 'but', 'shape', 'tape', 'cakes', 'on', 'all', 'of', 'these', 'combos', 'Any', 'tips', 'would', 'be', 'appreciated']",shape tape pillinghey everyone finally decided to try out shape tape after hearing so many good thing about it unfortunately it cake and roll off my skin any idea why or what could be causing this after applying it just cake and have to drag the makeup out and it just pill think maybe it the combo of my primer foundation and looking for good combo use honest beauty matte primer or milk hydro and armani luminous silk or oréal lumi but shape tape cake on all of these combo any tip would be appreciated
Makeup,"eyeshadow as eyelinerso I’ve recently found that the best suited eyeliner for my eye shape/skill level/desired look has been just using eyeshadow as eyeliner and doing a little wing. I have started to find the eyeshadow I’ve been using (the darkest colour from Sephora’s eye love light cool) isn’t dark enough pigment or colour-wise. I’m not a huge eyeshadow person (think glossier lidstar or bronzer on a day to day basis) so that is really the only powder eyeshadow I have kept during my declutters. For those who also use eyeshadow in this way, what has been your favourite deep/rich brown eyeshadow to help define your eyes? I don’t mind picking up a palette or a single and am fine with spending a little more for a good product! If it helps, I’m quite fair with darker blue eyes :)","['eyeshadow', 'as', 'eyelinerso', 've', 'recently', 'found', 'that', 'the', 'best', 'suited', 'eyeliner', 'for', 'my', 'eye', 'shape', 'skill', 'level', 'desired', 'look', 'has', 'been', 'just', 'using', 'eyeshadow', 'as', 'eyeliner', 'and', 'doing', 'little', 'wing', 'have', 'started', 'to', 'find', 'the', 'eyeshadow', 've', 'been', 'using', 'the', 'darkest', 'colour', 'from', 'Sephora', 'eye', 'love', 'light', 'cool', 'isn', 'dark', 'enough', 'pigment', 'or', 'colour', 'wise', 'not', 'huge', 'eyeshadow', 'person', 'think', 'glossier', 'lidstar', 'or', 'bronzer', 'on', 'day', 'to', 'day', 'basis', 'so', 'that', 'is', 'really', 'the', 'only', 'powder', 'eyeshadow', 'have', 'kept', 'during', 'my', 'declutters', 'For', 'those', 'who', 'also', 'use', 'eyeshadow', 'in', 'this', 'way', 'what', 'has', 'been', 'your', 'favourite', 'deep', 'rich', 'brown', 'eyeshadow', 'to', 'help', 'define', 'your', 'eyes', 'don', 'mind', 'picking', 'up', 'palette', 'or', 'single', 'and', 'am', 'fine', 'with', 'spending', 'little', 'more', 'for', 'good', 'product', 'If', 'it', 'helps', 'quite', 'fair', 'with', 'darker', 'blue', 'eyes']",eyeshadow a eyelinerso ve recently found that the best suited eyeliner for my eye shape skill level desired look ha been just using eyeshadow a eyeliner and doing little wing have started to find the eyeshadow ve been using the darkest colour from sephora eye love light cool isn dark enough pigment or colour wise not huge eyeshadow person think glossier lidstar or bronzer on day to day basis so that is really the only powder eyeshadow have kept during my declutters for those who also use eyeshadow in this way what ha been your favourite deep rich brown eyeshadow to help define your eye don mind picking up palette or single and am fine with spending little more for good product if it help quite fair with darker blue eye

......

🔹️PURPOSE: the purpose of this post is to highlight eight specific tools, that through my experience, I have found vital for using alongside makeup products. 

......

#1 - MINI SPRAY BOTTLES 


💲 Price Estimate: $1 


▪️WHY THIS IS BENEFICIAL: these are great to keep around! I currently have two of them - one filled with water, and one filled with isopropyl alcohol. I use the water-filled one frequently during makeup application to dampen metallic shades on my brush to help them apply more 'foiled'. I use the alcohol-filled one to keep my powder products disinfected and clean. These little bottles are small, making them very easy to store. They also have a good spraying mechanism, so if you wanted to apply anything directly to your face (perhaps you need to transfer a setting spray from a faulty bottle), they would perform just fine.  

......

#2 - MICROFIBER TOWELS 


💲 Price Estimate: $1 


▪️WHY THIS IS BENEFICIAL: having these as part of your makeup routine is beyond critical. I use one of these every single day, and they are a game-changer. You can use these to dry-clean your makeup brushes after you are finished using them, or between shades by simply wiping the brush and swirling it onto the fabric. The microfiber material completely cleans the bristles of any eyeshadow residue (by its clinging powers), making your brushes spotless again. These work in the same way as something like a 'color switch' does, but you get far more material for a far less price. I have a ton of these! The best thing is that when you completely fill-up your in-use towel, you simply throw it in the wash for next time!  

......

#3 - PARTITIONED PALETTE 


💲 Price Estimate: $1 


▪️WHY THIS IS BENEFICIAL: I tend to mix a lot of things together during makeup application, so something like this really comes in handy. You can literally use any flat surface you prefer as a mixing palette, but I really like a partitioned palette. It serves to contain your product as well as provide you several sections for use. Each section has enough space large enough to fit a brush, and subsequently pickup the product. For my personal mixing palette, I use a top to an old Rubbermaid salad container. It has served me well over the years! When you are finished using it, it simply wipes clean. For a more deep-cleanse, you can handwash it with a little dish soap, and let it air-dry. 

......

#4 - INSTANT BRUSH CLEANSER 


💲 Price Estimate: $10 - $30 


▪️WHY THIS IS BENEFICIAL: this is a HARDCORE necessity. There are so many brands with several options available, but I can't speak for any besides the Artís foaming cleanser. Cream products are really on trend right now, and as lovely as they are - they sure can mess up some brushes. If you leave those brushes to sit out and you don't immediately care for them, the brush's bristles get really gunked up, dried out, and are basically unusable. I use an instant brush cleanser every single time I use a brush with a liquid/cream product. I simply put a little foam on a microfiber towel, and then swirl my brush in the foam and cleanse it on the towel. It completely removes all the products, and makes the brush look brand new. An instant cleanser doesn't take long to dry, so the brushes are almost instantaneously reusable. They don't need that extra time to set-out and dry overnight. An instant brush cleanser is also a valuable product to have if you are a person that doesn't often get around to deep-cleaning your entire brush collection on a routine schedule. This could extend the time between washings, and will keep your brushes shipshape. 

......

#5 - COTTON SWABS 


💲 Price Estimate: $1 


▪️WHY THIS IS BENEFICIAL: this is kind of a boring one, but one I use so frequently that I just HAD to mention it. Cotton swabs are extremely multipurpose. My favorite 'makeup' way to utilize them is to simply swipe a clean swab along my waterline prior to applying an eyeliner. It removes any moisture on the waterline and allows for the ultimate application - supremely pigmented and ultra-smooth. You can also use cotton swabs to masterfully clean-up any small makeup mishaps, or even use them as a fun, unique eyeshadow applicator. A pack of these doesn't cost a ton, and they are great to have around your beauty space. 

......

#6 - LARGE COATED MAGNET 


💲 Price Estimate: $5 


▪️WHY THIS IS BENEFICIAL: it took me awhile to find a 'good' one, but I've finally found it. I really like customizing my eyeshadow palettes (those that have removable pans) and creating color-stories that are more appealing to me. Although magnetic, attempting to pry them out with a non-magnetic flat tool can cause immense damage to both the shadow and the pan. The best way to go is by using a strong, effective magnet that isn't going to affect the condition of the eyeshadow or its componentry. The strength of the magnet is important, as you want to ensure you get one large enough to remove eyeshadow pans, but not overly strong where it harms the shadows. I use this a LOT, and it's really served me well so far!

......

#7 - SALINE SOLUTION 


💲 Price Estimate: $3 


▪️WHY THIS IS BENEFICIAL: this is one of those things that's just always advantageous to keep on hand. It's not necessarily something that needs to be permanently stored IN your makeup collection, however - I find myself reaching for it quite often. If you are a person that enjoys getting the most 'mileage' out of your makeup products, using a saline solution will help you achieve that. If you are experiencing a product that has sort of dried-out or dehydrated over time, yet it's still within expiration terms - a little added saline solution will assist in reviving the formula. I add this to many of my liquid eyeshadows, liquid glitter liners, and sometimes brow pomades to improve the functionality. It's a cheap way to renew a product without having to wastefully toss it, just to buy another.

......

#8 - LASH SEPARATOR 


💲 Price Estimate: $2 


▪️WHY THIS IS BENEFICIAL: I bought this years ago, and it's still going strong! This is something that I use each and every time that I work on my eyelashes. No matter the mascara, I have an issue where the outer portion of my lashes clump and stick together. This tool is a lash savior! If you experience any lash sticking or clumping, this easily and swiftly combs the lashes into a uniform position. This is especially great if you are dealing with a mascara that is giving you trouble - it truly separates each individual lash.

Makeup,"Newbie To False LashesHi everyone, I am considering adding false lashes to my makeup routine. A couple things to note:

1. I WFH and wear make up tops 3x a week, more on vaca which is only a couple times a year. 

2. The skin under my eyes is extremely sensitive and taking mascara off has caused terrible reactions and visits to the derm - I’d like to avoid the awful pain of removing mascara and go with lashes in the hopes of saving my skin.

3. I’ve never applied flash lashes on myself, only other time I had them was on my wedding day and I believe glue was used. I’m a little apprehensive to go the glue route in case of a reaction.

I’ve seen magnetic lashes, are they heavy? Any tips or recommendations of brands or styles for absolute amateurs for lashes?

Thank you!","['Newbie', 'To', 'False', 'LashesHi', 'everyone', 'am', 'considering', 'adding', 'false', 'lashes', 'to', 'my', 'makeup', 'routine', 'couple', 'things', 'to', 'note', 'WFH', 'and', 'wear', 'make', 'up', 'tops', '3x', 'week', 'more', 'on', 'vaca', 'which', 'is', 'only', 'couple', 'times', 'year', 'The', 'skin', 'under', 'my', 'eyes', 'is', 'extremely', 'sensitive', 'and', 'taking', 'mascara', 'off', 'has', 'caused', 'terrible', 'reactions', 'and', 'visits', 'to', 'the', 'derm', 'like', 'to', 'avoid', 'the', 'awful', 'pain', 'of', 'removing', 'mascara', 'and', 'go', 'with', 'lashes', 'in', 'the', 'hopes', 'of', 'saving', 'my', 'skin', 've', 'never', 'applied', 'flash', 'lashes', 'on', 'myself', 'only', 'other', 'time', 'had', 'them', 'was', 'on', 'my', 'wedding', 'day', 'and', 'believe', 'glue', 'was', 'used', 'little', 'apprehensive', 'to', 'go', 'the', 'glue', 'route', 'in', 'case', 'of', 'reaction', 've', 'seen', 'magnetic', 'lashes', 'are', 'they', 'heavy', 'Any', 'tips', 'or', 'recommendations', 'of', 'brands', 'or', 'styles', 'for', 'absolute', 'amateurs', 'for', 'lashes', 'Thank', 'you']",newbie to false lasheshi everyone am considering adding false lash to my makeup routine couple thing to note wfh and wear make up top 3x week more on vaca which is only couple time year the skin under my eye is extremely sensitive and taking mascara off ha caused terrible reaction and visit to the derm like to avoid the awful pain of removing mascara and go with lash in the hope of saving my skin ve never applied flash lash on myself only other time had them wa on my wedding day and believe glue wa used little apprehensive to go the glue route in case of reaction ve seen magnetic lash are they heavy any tip or recommendation of brand or style for absolute amateur for lash thank you

Makeup,"What is a good brand of foundation for dry, sensitive skin?I have been thinking about changing my foundation for a while now. I just ran out of my Wet N Wild dewy foundation (in shell ivory) and was thinking about changing it up. Lately Wet N Wild has been breaking me out every time I use it. I’ve always used drugstore, but now I’m thinking about trying a good brand (as long as it is under $50).

Here is some information about me: 
I have dry, extremely sensitive skin.
I prefer the makeup to be cruelty free. 
I don’t really care if it is full coverage, I just want something that will cover my acne scars that I received from skin care I had a extreme breakout from.

Makeup,"Foundation tips 

Hi, there! I am getting married next month and I am 46. My skin has always been easy to deal with, normal, never really broke out and I haven't really looked my age until the last 4-5 years or so. My dermatologist says I still look to be in my 30s but I am not sure I believe it. LOL

Anyways the point of my post is that as I have aged I am developing some of the ""orange peel texture""look on my upper cheeks below my ""under eye area"". The derm explained getting older, losing plumpness, peptides can help, etc etc. I ordered The Ordinary ""Buffet"" to try it out as it has good reviews for peptides.

My main question is over the last few years I am having a terrible time with foundations. I had never had an issue before.

Using a brush or a sponge, my makeup doesn't look smooth anymore when I put it on. It sometimes looks smeary or smudgy. I use No 7 Lift and Luminate nightly cream and I stopped using the day cream version, because I thought it might be causing the trouble since it is so thick and often is still tacky even when dry. However, I have found even with a cetaphil lightweight moisturizer I am having this issue.

Right now the only thing I can get to look okay is the Cetaphil tinted moisturizer cream (applied with sponge) and powder to set it, then a light brush of bronzer to even out my color. It works okay, but I am not in love with it- especially for my wedding!

I would like to wear a more covering foundation again and I want my face to have a non-smudgy or  
non-smeared looking finish.

I understand that the look of airbrushing doesn't look flawless up close, but does it look good from a few feet away? LOL I really want to try the Sephora airbrush foundation spray. If that doesn't work out for me, what other foundations do you suggest? I have a ton of different primers, too- my last favorite was the NYX Marshmallow. However, they haven't seemed to make a difference with my foundation issues, so I am wondering I am just not starting with a good base to begin with.

I wash my face every morning with cool water to wipe off any moisturizer from the night before. I am not greasy so don't feel like I need to use a face wash.

I have blonde hair and very fair skin, however I do color nicely if I choose to tan (which I avoid) and I have blue eyes. I seem to be a more neutral undertone as opposed to a pink or a yellow. I have people suggest trying Estee Lauder foundation today, so I will also look into that.

Sorry if I am all over the place! I am normally not so disorganized with my posts- I think wedding stress has fried my brain! LOL

Makeup,"Any such thing as an eyelash tinter?hi everyone, I don’t use much makeup but I am going to get back into using makeup as I’m growing my eyelashes back. I’ve had trichotillomania for most of my life (addiction to pulling out hair) so I’m usually completely eyelash-less. this look is not appealing to me so I’m growing them back.

the last time I grew them back I used mascara to darken them, but mascara coats eyelashes and leaves them hardened almost. this texture provokes me to touch my eyelashes excessively which makes me relapse eventually. so I’m wondering if there are mascaras that do not leave this coat and just tint them a darker color temporarily.","['Any', 'such', 'thing', 'as', 'an', 'eyelash', 'tinter', 'hi', 'everyone', 'don', 'use', 'much', 'makeup', 'but', 'am', 'going', 'to', 'get', 'back', 'into', 'using', 'makeup', 'as', 'growing', 'my', 'eyelashes', 'back', 've', 'had', 'trichotillomania', 'for', 'most', 'of', 'my', 'life', 'addiction', 'to', 'pulling', 'out', 'hair', 'so', 'usually', 'completely', 'eyelash', 'less', 'this', 'look', 'is', 'not', 'appealing', 'to', 'me', 'so', 'growing', 'them', 'back', 'the', 'last', 'time', 'grew', 'them', 'back', 'used', 'mascara', 'to', 'darken', 'them', 'but', 'mascara', 'coats', 'eyelashes', 'and', 'leaves', 'them', 'hardened', 'almost', 'this', 'texture', 'provokes', 'me', 'to', 'touch', 'my', 'eyelashes', 'excessively', 'which', 'makes', 'me', 'relapse', 'eventually', 'so', 'wondering', 'if', 'there', 'are', 'mascaras', 'that', 'do', 'not', 'leave', 'this', 'coat', 'and', 'just', 'tint', 'them', 'darker', 'color', 'temporarily']",any such thing a an eyelash tinter hi everyone don use much makeup but am going to get back into using makeup a growing my eyelash back ve had trichotillomania for most of my life addiction to pulling out hair so usually completely eyelash le this look is not appealing to me so growing them back the last time grew them back used mascara to darken them but mascara coat eyelash and leaf them hardened almost this texture provokes me to touch my eyelash excessively which make me relapse eventually so wondering if there are mascara that do not leave this coat and just tint them darker color temporarily

Makeup,"Looking For Foundation Recommendations - Any Help Appreciated 🙏Long story short I’m not very girly and am pretty clueless when it comes to makeup. I’d really like to try out different things but I’ve honestly no idea where to start. Currently I use foundation by Illamasqua as it was recommended to me by a MUA, however by the end of the day it looks cakey and well, just a bit crap. 

I have really pale skin and thanks to an autoimmune disease that causes flare ups, there tends to be a constant redness on my face too! 

My skin is often dry so I tend to moisturise quite heavily before applying to try and get as much time without it looking / feeling dry.  

I’m UK based, if anyone has any recommendations for foundations (or even primer? To be honest I don’t know where to start with that either!) I’d be forever grateful! Trying to feel a little more girly and confident!

Makeup,"Are there any good recommendations for a bright rainbow/pastel eyeshadow palette that contains non toxic or organic ingredients?Hi, so long story short I wanna cosplay and being new to makeup I’ve been looking for non toxic products because I’m scared of products that cause rash or irritation.

I was originally considering the James Charles Palette (disregarding that he got canceled so I don’t support him anymore, I love the colors in that palette) but after doing some research on it the palette contains extremely toxic ingredients that I would like to avoid.

I specifically need bright palette colors so that it shows up on cosplay makeup and is more diverse for multiple cosplays- essentially I’m not going to wear it out on a daily basis for regular use.

Does anyone have any good recommendations on a good colorful eyeshadow palette with diverse colors that contains completely non toxic ingredients? If there are none that exist because realistically bright colors likely do contain toxic ingredients, is there any good recommendations that contains little toxic ingredients or ingredients that will not cause rashes inflammation or rashes? 

Also I’m new to makeup so should I just bypass this whole problem and get the James Charles pallet? Are the health concerns a huge deal? What are the side effects of constantly wearing makeup that isn’t non toxic?

Sorry I’m asking so many questions, I just worry about my skin and my health as I already struggle with acne and oily skin and irritation

Makeup,"Suggestions on how to use ‘Better Than Sex’ mascaraHi all! I’m a little new to the group!
I wanted to take your advice on how to make the most out of ‘Better Than Sex’ Mascara.

I gave into the hype and bought it but I feel it’s like any other mascara. I have noticed that a lot of the product gets collected on the wand’s tip and doesn’t come on the brush properly. 

Usually after putting mascara, I curl my lashes, followed by another round of mascara.

Makeup,"What is your experience on men preferring makeup or noneHi all, I’m not sure if this is the right sub to ask. So I have lash extensions, used to wear volume and now I’m doing hybrid. I don’t wear much makeup (brows and concealer) but the lashes make it look like a full face. 
My experience for the year+ I’ve had them is family and guys telling me it doesn’t suit me, better off natural. I try to see the man’s perspective and why. They tell me they prefer a girl with or minimal to none. 
I always thought it was a bullshit answer because guys reply to stories with compliments of me in full face then switch up and say they want natural. 
My full face is tinted moisturizer, concealer, brows, highlight, bit of eyeshadow to pop my eyes. (Which I rarely do) 
Pretty much every guy says I’m beautiful without makeup. So it makes me overthink and I’ve been debating removing lashes and feeling it out. 
And a huge part of me doesn’t want to listen to a man’s opinion but if my family and every guy says it, maybe they’re right ?

Makeup,"New Makeup Releases - Inspired or Tired?[Pictures are available on my profile, if you are interested!]


🛍 New Makeup Releases ... Inspired or Tired? 🧹 

...... 

➡️ NOTE: the information contained within this post is based upon my research, opinions, and experience. As always, buy/use the products that make YOU happy. Also, none of my stuff is sponsored. I do it for fun. 

...... 

🔹️PURPOSE: ...LET'S TALK MAKEUP! This is just window-shopping the new beauty releases (one of my favorite things to do!) Sometimes, I come across some really awesome, inspiring products - other times, I feel some type of way about a few of these releases. Read on to find out if I'm 'Inspired or Tired' by these 9 new products! 


✅ Inspired = possibly going on my wishlist 


❌ Tired = why? 

...... 

▪️Sydney Grace - March 2022 Bundle 


💲 Price: $20.00 


➡️ Classification: Indie Makeup 


✅ INSPIRED 


☕ I truly believe that the Sydney Grace quality is unparalleled. They are one of the few brands that I have come to continually *expect* greatness from, because they've previously delivered so many times. What *really* enticed me about this month's bundle is the unusual blue scheme. Firstly, I am an outright sucker for a blue eyeshadow, then - adding in the fact that they are atypical shades is making them even more captivating. I love how they paired the bold, vibrant blues with very neutral browns - it's just an overall well-done bundle and easy-to-wear. From this set, I can envision creating a complete eye look out of the five provided shades without having to bring in any companion products. I also love the inspiration of 'California' - the carefreeness and freedom that the Cali-life portrays. Lastly, I'm really trying to build and curate my 'singles' collection, and this set would make a profound addition to my growing collection. 

...... 

▪️Dominique Cosmetics - The Moment Eyeshadow Palette 


💲 Price: $? 


➡️ Classification: Influencer-brand Makeup / Indie Makeup 


❌ TIRED 


☕ Again - I'm a complete blue-eyeshadow enthusiast, and this palette *really* speaks to me on a certain level. However, I just can't continue wasting my money on Dominique Cosmetics eyeshadow palettes! I've bought every single one thus far, and not ONE of them has worked in my favor. I find them nearly impossible to blend-out (and I get the worst looks and harshest lines), taking into consideration *every* formula that I own. I love the concept of the brand, and I'm truly charmed by each one of her releases. There just has to be a definitive point as to where I quit wasting my time and efforts on products that I *cannot* get to work. 

...... 

▪️Melt Cosmetics - Slick Waterline Pencils 


💲 Price: $19.00 


➡️ Classification: Indie Makeup 


✅ INSPIRED 


☕ I've been in dire need of a pencil specifically formulated for the waterline, and I just came across this release! Assuming all the claims are true about these pencils, this is *exactly* what I have been looking for. I especially shop Melt Cosmetics for all their unique shades, and I'm definitely intrigued by several of the shades offered. I'm really hoping to grab one (or maybe two!) and see if these live up to the hype. They sound great in theory...but do they actually work? 

...... 

▪️Chanel - Stylo Lumière Regard 


💲 Price: $36.00 


➡️ Classification: Luxury Makeup 


❌ TIRED 


☕ This is just a giant *no*. I have distinct, trustworthy sources where I seek information regarding certain product launches. Everybody that I absolutely believe in (that reviews luxury makeup products) has despised these highlighter pens. Apparently they are a new style of product for Chanel, something that's never been done before. I saw both shades in action, applied in a multitude of ways - and the performance was awful, and definitely not indicative of a luxury makeup product. 


......


▪️Black Radiance - True Complexion Tinted Moisturizer 


💲 Price: $7.99 


➡️ Classification: Drugstore Makeup 


✅ INSPIRED 


☕ It's really been awhile since Black Radiance released a new product, so this is a welcomed rarity! In my experience with the brand, I've always been pleasantly surprised with its workings. Tinted moisturizers are one of the hottest makeup trends, so it doesn't really surprise me that they jumped on the opportunity. A tinted moisturizer-type product was also a void in their product lineup, so this launch makes sense. Considering both my familiarity with the brand *and* the cost of this product, I'm willing to buy it and try it out! 

...... 

▪️Flower Beauty - Pyramids Cheek Color 


💲 Price: $11.00 


➡️ Classification: Drugstore Makeup 


❌ TIRED 


☕ The reality is that I never have any success with a product like this, and I end up getting frustrated and frenzied during application. This product is indeed supposed to be a face palette, each area segmented out. However, problems arise as there are no barriers between products. I also don't like that the texture and finish of the *entire* face palette is identical. I can attest to the fact that the actual product looks chic and snazzy - but unless utilized for one-step in the makeup routine, it's just unreasonable. 

...... 

▪️Makeup Revolution - IRL Filter Longwear Foundation 


💲 Price: $14.00 


➡️ Classification: Affordable Makeup 


✅ INSPIRED 


☕ I know many of you may disagree, but I am excited about this one! Makeup Revolution has some excellent complexion products. Every single piece that I've ever tried has been top-notch and reflective of a much higher-end product. The claims and benefits of this foundation seem exactly like one that I would find great joy in wearing. I would really have a lot of fun doing a full-day wear-test on this formula, and finding out how it differs from the other Makeup Revolution foundations! 

...... 

▪️Rimmel London - Kind &amp; Free Clean Mascara 


💲 Price: $7.49 


➡️ Classification: Drugstore Makeup 


❌ TIRED 


☕ Well, I really have nothing against this, honestly. I actually really, really, really like Rimmel London - as they are hardcore one of my favorite drugstore brands! This frankly just looks and sounds really boring to me. It doesn't boast any monumental differences from top-rated formulas, and the packaging itself is awfully subpar. Rimmel is known for offering fantastic quality for a much-lower price, and this mascara's cost doesn't seem to align with their other offerings. It's just not something I'm interested in. 

...... 

▪️Pat McGrath Labs x Bridgerton - SatinAllure Lipstick 


💲 Price: $28.00 


➡️ Classification: Luxury Makeup 


✅ INSPIRED 


☕ Oh, excuse me - this is probably awfully haughty - but I simply want one of these for the limited, upgraded, exclusive packaging! How adorable is this lipstick casing component? I have a lipstick display on my vanity where I showcase my most-beautifully packaged lipsticks, and this would be so delightful as an addition! Of course, the colors are incredibly wearable when it comes to my personal 'every day' makeup taste, so I'd get a lot of actual use out of it, too!

Makeup,"Top 3 Underrated Hidden K-beauty Brands.(Clean, Vegan, and Cruelty-free) 1. [Completone](https://completone.us/) (Serumkind/ Surebase) : Vegan, Cruelty-free, No paraben.  

\- Completone is a brand that focuses on serums(Serumkind) and foundations(Surebase). Their products are 100% vegan, cruelty-free, and contain no paraben.  Completone's Chaga charging drop is made with Siberian Chaga mushroom which helps with supercharging and multi-nourishing. Also, their long lasting foundations were highly recommended by 'Vogue'. I'm personally using Completone's products (Chaga charging drop, Deep antarctic drop, and Glad glow foundation) and really loving it. The dewy finish of the foundation is especially amazing. 

2. [Round A’Round](https://global.oliveyoung.com/display/page/brand-page?brandNo=B00121) : Clean beauty

\- From skincare to bathing products, Round A'round has a variety of products. Their 'Green Tea Pure Cleansing Foam' is a go to product if you are looking for a mild and moisturizing cleansing form. It even won Olive Young's 2021 awards. Currently using the sample and planning to purchase one in the future. They have good skin care products as well. So if you like the cleansing form you can also try their toner, serum, and cream. 

3. [Beauty of Joseon](https://beautyofjoseon.com/): Cruelty-free

Makeup,"Best all brown/tan matte palettes? Is the master mattes by Mario good?So I’ve become somewhat of a makeup minimalist.

Makeup,"Need advice on eyebrows bc the DISAPPEAR IN PHOTOS?!- PLEASE HELP!**Some detail/history:** Unfortunately, I am not gifted in the topic of eyebrows (makeup wise and actual hair wise). My eyebrows  have alwayssss been problem/insecurity for me.  I don't have a ton of hair, and the hair I do have is a  mixture of light brown and brown. I've tinted them AND gotten them microbladed (not at same time) and my eyebrows are still not what I want them to be. I really thought microblading was the answer, but I'm here *still* struggling after dropping a ton of money  on that. I love the natural fluffy brow look and I know  there are obviously limitations to what I can do to have that because of what my natural brows are, but I am going insane. The only time they remotely got to what I  wanted was when I started using an eyebrow growth serurm, which I have started to use again. 

**New problem that is driving me crazy -**  on top of all that annoyingness, something new has started  happening which is that when I take photos with flash, my eyebrows like DISAPPEAR?! it  really makes absolutely NO sense to me beucase they definitely have color in natrual lighting. I use a darker pencil and a darker shade than my  natrual color of eybrow gel on them to get them more defined/filled in. Someone PLEEASEEEE give me some advice.

Makeup,"Eyeliner for unevenly hooded eyes?I am relatively inexperienced with makeup but have been trying to do more lately. My eyes are partially hooded but I feel like the eyelid crease is a little different on each eye. So when I try to do a winged eyeliner, it is never even. When I do a small wing that stops before the hood crease, you can’t even really see it when my eyes are open, but if I lift my eyebrows up you can see it. When I try a bigger wing, I can never make them even because of the hoods- it either looks ok when my eyes are fully open or ok when my eyes are more closed.. never both. Am I the only one with uneven hoods or is there some trick I’m missing when it comes to eyeliner?

Makeup,"Foundation/moisturizing help for mild rosaceaHello! I have mild rosacea which makes my skin dry and blotchy. I’ve always had issues with dry skin and I feel like no matter how much water I drink or moisturizing things I use, when I put on my foundation it still looks patchy/dry/cakey. I’ve been using Clinique Redness Solutions because it’s the best foundation I’ve found to cover up my redness, however, I feel like I can’t get rid of the dryness regardless of what I use under it so it never looks smooth.

Makeup,"Makeup Help PLEASESo I’m just gonna put it all out here. I’ve recently had a baby (I say recently but she’s 15 months 🤦🏼‍♀️) and I’m just really going through some shit. My hair is still falling out in clumps and my skin is just wrecked and pretty much all my self esteem is in the toilet, so I just really need some good makeup/skin advice. 

So I have acne prone skin and it’s a combination of dry and oily. I have lots of acne scars and I think my pores are huge. I’m 26 and have always struggled with acne. I’ve tried a good amount of acne products, including dermatologist prescribed, and nothing has really helped. A few years ago though, I stopped wearing makeup on a daily basis and my skin cleared up, at least for the most part. Well recently, not only have I had a baby, I’ve switched to a job where I have to wear makeup everyday. 
I’ve been having a TON of breakouts and towards the end of the work day, just a regular 8 hour office job work day, my skin gets oily and my foundation and powder gets… blotchy and I don’t know fuzzy looking. I need something that’s long lasting, but light weight. 

Here was my old makeup/skin care routine until I tried to change things up over the weekend. 
1. Cetaphil extra gentle daily scrub
2. Ponds dry skin care cream
3. Maybelline master prime 
4. Eyes and brows 
5. Kokie be bright concealer- under eyes and problem areas, blended with beauty blender
6. Maybelline dream bb pure skin clearing beauty balm- blended with beauty blender 
7. Nyx cant stop won’t stop powder- blended with brush 
8. Blush and highlighter 

So I recently changed a few things and I feel like my makeup like rolls off my face now. It’s super clumpy and I’m still having the same blotchy problems. 
2. Cetaphil gentle clear mattifying acne moisturizer 
3. Revlon prime plus mattifying and pore reducing primer 
7. L’Oréal infallible 24hr fresh wear powder 

What am I doing wrong that my skin is so screwed up? Please please help me. 😩 😩

Makeup,"Lightweight foundation + acne scars?Hello! I’ve got a makeup situation.

I haven’t worn much makeup for the past few years, and I’m looking for a new product for daily wear in the summer. My acne has been reduced to a lot of red scarring, and while I don’t need a full coverage product, I’m looking for something so hide the redness while remaining lightweight.

I’ve got super(!) oily skin and am rather pale with neutral undertones. My skin is very sensitive.

Are there any products you would recommend? A tinted moisturizer or BB/CC cream maybe? Anything to hide the scars but feel like I’m barely wearing makeup.

Makeup,"Too Faced Matte Foundation separating and patchy!Okay so I recently bought the Too Faced Born This Way Matte foundation and I LOVE their original satin formula so I was excited for the matte formula release. However, this new matte foundation is separating so bad! I’m not sure if it might be conflicting with products I use before my foundation but again I’ve never had any with other foundations. Here is my current pre foundation skincare routine:
- Drunk Elephant Beste No. 9 Jelly Cleanser 
-OLEHENRIKSEN Banana Bright Vitamin C Serum 
-Biossance Squalane + Copper Peptide Rapid Plumping Serum
- Drunk Elephant Protini Polypeptide Cream
-  Laura Mercier Pure Canvas Primer Blurring (on only my t zone) 
- Milk Makeup Hydrogrip Primer (everywhere else on my face)
I also use either the Urban Decay All Nighter Setting Spray or the Hourglass Veil Soft Focus Setting Spray to help blend out my foundation. I place my foundation on my face and spray with my setting spray and then blend it out with my sponge (I’ve used both sprays with the foundation and it still separates with either spray so I don’t think that could be the problem.)
I have about 5 foundations and use the same routine for all of them and never had any problems.

I haven’t heard anybody have a separating issue before and I just want to make it work );","['Too', 'Faced', 'Matte', 'Foundation', 'separating', 'and', 'patchy', 'Okay', 'so', 'recently', 'bought', 'the', 'Too', 'Faced', 'Born', 'This', 'Way', 'Matte', 'foundation', 'and', 'LOVE', 'their', 'original', 'satin', 'formula', 'so', 'was', 'excited', 'for', 'the', 'matte', 'formula', 'release', 'However', 'this', 'new', 'matte', 'foundation', 'is', 'separating', 'so', 'bad', 'not', 'sure', 'if', 'it', 'might', 'be', 'conflicting', 'with', 'products', 'use', 'before', 'my', 'foundation', 'but', 'again', 've', 'never', 'had', 'any', 'with', 'other', 'foundations', 'Here', 'is', 'my', 'current', 'pre', 'foundation', 'skincare', 'routine', 'Drunk', 'Elephant', 'Beste', 'No', 'Jelly', 'Cleanser', 'OLEHENRIKSEN', 'Banana', 'Bright', 'Vitamin', 'Serum', 'Biossance', 'Squalane', 'Copper', 'Peptide', 'Rapid', 'Plumping', 'Serum', 'Drunk', 'Elephant', 'Protini', 'Polypeptide', 'Cream', 'Laura', 'Mercier', 'Pure', 'Canvas', 'Primer', 'Blurring', 'on', 'only', 'my', 'zone', 'Milk', 'Makeup', 'Hydrogrip', 'Primer', 'everywhere', 'else', 'on', 'my', 'face', 'also', 'use', 'either', 'the', 'Urban', 'Decay', 'All', 'Nighter', 'Setting', 'Spray', 'or', 'the', 'Hourglass', 'Veil', 'Soft', 'Focus', 'Setting', 'Spray', 'to', 'help', 'blend', 'out', 'my', 'foundation', 'place', 'my', 'foundation', 'on', 'my', 'face', 'and', 'spray', 'with', 'my', 'setting', 'spray', 'and', 'then', 'blend', 'it', 'out', 'with', 'my', 'sponge', 've', 'used', 'both', 'sprays', 'with', 'the', 'foundation', 'and', 'it', 'still', 'separates', 'with', 'either', 'spray', 'so', 'don', 'think', 'that', 'could', 'be', 'the', 'problem', 'have', 'about', 'foundations', 'and', 'use', 'the', 'same', 'routine', 'for', 'all', 'of', 'them', 'and', 'never', 'had', 'any', 'problems', 'haven', 'heard', 'anybody', 'have', 'separating', 'issue', 'before', 'and', 'just', 'want', 'to', 'make', 'it', 'work']",too faced matte foundation separating and patchy okay so recently bought the too faced born this way matte foundation and love their original satin formula so wa excited for the matte formula release however this new matte foundation is separating so bad not sure if it might be conflicting with product use before my foundation but again ve never had any with other foundation here is my current pre foundation skincare routine drunk elephant beste no jelly cleanser olehenriksen banana bright vitamin serum biossance squalane copper peptide rapid plumping serum drunk elephant protini polypeptide cream laura mercier pure canvas primer blurring on only my zone milk makeup hydrogrip primer everywhere else on my face also use either the urban decay all nighter setting spray or the hourglass veil soft focus setting spray to help blend out my foundation place my foundation on my face and spray with my setting spray and then blend it out with my sponge ve used both spray with the foundation and it still separate with either spray so don think that could be the problem have about foundation and use the same routine for all of them and never had any problem haven heard anybody have separating issue before and just want to make it work

Makeup,"will makeup improve/lessen my hooded eyes? (linked pictures)I'll link two pictures below, one first thing in the morning (what I feel is my ugliest) and another where I feel like I look a  little more put together. I'm also open to any other makeup suggestions.

Makeup,"Advice on adding color to a very fair faceHey y’all! 

So I’m the lightest shade of Fenty (not even her lightest concealer gives me that lighter eye area, it’s just the right color). 

I lean more towards natural makeup these days, but I can’t get around having a pale face and very light golden lashes/brows. I feel I have zero contrast where many have beautiful brown facial hair to give them some oomph. Also black and even brown mascara just appear too harsh. Ugh.

What tips or tricks could you recommend? 

I’ve already ditched the blush further back and brought it back to the apples of my cheeks. It helps a lot, despite it not being as *trendy*. At this point I’ll try anything to feel better in my skin.

i use concealer as foundation, basically i just put it lightly on the center of my forehead, my cheeks, and a little on my chin. i use it to hide blushing. the brand of concealer is wet and wild, and it says something about incognito on it. im pale myself, but i buy it a shade lighter cuz i like looking pale.

anyway, recently i took a picture with flash on my phone and i noticed that my face looked like it was literally reflecting light 😭 that picture was pretty up close though and the pictures at school will be far away.

Makeup,"Yet another foundation question…I have been under an insane amount of stress and am having stress/hormonal breakouts.  I have used Nars Sheer Glow for about two years now and have been pretty happy with it, but lately it seems like it never looks as good as it used to. I’ve tried changing primers and setting sprays and haven’t found anything that really helps. 

Is it normal for a foundation to stop working as good with your skin after using the same thing for awhile?

I’m in my early 40’s with some sun damaged and fine lines starting to show. I’ve always had kind of sensitive, dry skin. 

Can anyone recommend something I should try?  I’m dreading the process of buying and returning foundations over and over again until I find one that works so any suggestions would be very helpful.

Makeup,"What are the best under eye concealers/powders?I have been having problems finding concealers and powders for my under eye area due to fine lines/creasing.

Makeup,"Foundation and concealer for acne prone combination skin?Hello everyone,

I hardly ever wear makeup because I have such bad skin and wearing makeup usually just breaks me out even more. But I have an out of town wedding I'm attending in a couple of weeks and I'm needing some advice.

Makeup,"Replacement Foundation Pump AdviceHi everyone-- a while ago I purchased the Bobbi Brown Skin Foundation SPF 15. It comes in this lovely little glass jar with a plastic dispenser head, it's your typical pump-style makeup/skincare dispenser. I brought it with me when I flew home for Christmas. I've never had a problem with air travel and this particular dispenser before, but something happened to the dispenser that has rendered it unusable.

I can't even shake the bottle without it spraying product everywhere. If I use the pump it leaks product all around the plastic head (wasting it basically). The only way I've been able to use it is by manually stirring with the straw part of the dispenser and then using that like a wand to swipe some on the back of my hand.

I'm wondering if anyone has any bottle ideas/good replacement container/re-potting suggestions. I worry that every time I unscrew the bottle I'm exposing the foundation to air/bacteria. The bottle is still almost full so I am reluctant to just say ""screw it"" and repurchase.

I'll be staying abroad for a few months so I was wondering if I should get one more of these tools in case mine runs out, or if it's that kind of product that never seems to run out lol","['MAC', 'eyebrow', 'tool', 'Hi', 'was', 'wondering', 'if', 'anyone', 'here', 'is', 'using', 'the', 'MAC', 'shape', 'shade', 'eyebrow', 'tool', 'the', 'one', 'with', 'the', 'marker', 'on', 'one', 'end', 'and', 'some', 'powdered', 'pigment', 'on', 'the', 'other', 've', 'been', 'using', 'it', 'for', 'few', 'weeks', 'now', 'and', 'love', 'it', 'however', 'have', 'no', 'clue', 'as', 'to', 'how', 'long', 'can', 'expect', 'the', 'product', 'to', 'last', 'me', 'using', 'it', 'almost', 'every', 'day', 'll', 'be', 'staying', 'abroad', 'for', 'few', 'months', 'so', 'was', 'wondering', 'if', 'should', 'get', 'one', 'more', 'of', 'these', 'tools', 'in', 'case', 'mine', 'runs', 'out', 'or', 'if', 'it', 'that', 'kind', 'of', 'product', 'that', 'never', 'seems', 'to', 'run', 'out', 'lol']",mac eyebrow tool hi wa wondering if anyone here is using the mac shape shade eyebrow tool the one with the marker on one end and some powdered pigment on the other ve been using it for few week now and love it however have no clue a to how long can expect the product to last me using it almost every day ll be staying abroad for few month so wa wondering if should get one more of these tool in case mine run out or if it that kind of product that never seems to run out lol

Makeup,"Can somebody identify which ingredients make these setting powders work?I have really oily skin and I found three setting powders that make my makeup last all day, but I'm not sure what ingredients make them different.  When I apply them, my foundation doesn't feel tacky, it has a smooth/dry feel.  Not dry as in dry skin, but as in the foundation isn't wet anymore.  I'm curious as to what makes it work because it's wasteful to try new powders, realize they don't work as well, and return it.  

Kat Von D powder, Coty airspun, and pressed powders always gave my foundation a wet or tacky feel, like if I touched my face it would rub off.  It also had more creases and my eye makeup wouldn't last as long.  My skin also looked oily throughout the day.

Makeup,"What can I do if literally nothing covers my circles?So, my problem is, that I always have dark undereye circles since I'm 15. The doctor said I don't have enough iron, so I take iron, and eat beetroot.

Makeup,"Need advice— Lip gloss keeps rubbing offHi guys, first time posting here and would love any advice. I just started using the Glossier lip gloss and it’s the best I’ve ever used.

You might be surprised at the quality of stuff they have! There's often products on clearance that have no label, so it would look tidier when you organize your makeup. If you don't like branding being shoved in your face and just want a good product, it works well.

I have never been good at putting on lashes, the ones with glue look awful and I am allergic to the glue.

🔺️ PALETTE: Beauty Bay - Sunset Horizons Palette✌

......

🔺️ ACQUIRED: purchased myself through Beauty Bay

......

👁 LOOK CREATED: 'Sunset Eye'

......

▪️ PACKAGING &amp; DESIGN: each pan holds 1.4g of product, square-shaped pans, simple cardboard packaging, bi-fold, palette name &amp; brand is on cover, luxe-weight, magnetic closure system, medium rectangular shape, mid-size mirror inside, tried a heavy magnet &amp; pans are NOT removable, shade names are designated southwards of each shadow 


🔊 NOTICE: 

+ At 1.4g, each shadow weighs slightly ABOVE the average amount per pan. I don't think anybody would find difficulty in storing this palette.

......

▪️ COUNTRY OF ORIGIN: China

......

▪️ TOTAL # OF SHADES: 20 (mixture of eyeshadows &amp; pressed pigments; pressed pigments are not 'eye safe' according to FDA law)

......

▪️ TYPES OF FORMULAS: 2 formulas (14 mattes, 6 metallics)

......

▪️ DESIGNATION: mix-toned (warm &amp; cool)

......

▪️ DEXTERITY CONCERNS: the magnet on this palette is strong, and can be tough to open

......

▪️ DESCRIPTION OF SHADE PRESS: varies from soft to moderate; some shades are really powdery, whereas others are harder pressed. Definitely recommend doing eyes before base with this palette. 

......

▪️ EXTRA PERTINENT INFORMATION: inspired by the contrasting hues of an autumn sunset, another installment in Beauty Bay's 20-pan series

&lt;$2=excellent; $3-$4=affordable; $5-$8=meh; $9-$15=expensive; &gt;$16=very expensive

......

🔎 REVIEW: 


🔸️PATCHINESS: no patchiness 


🔸️BLENDABILITY: very easy to blend out 


🔸️KICK-BACK/FALL-OUT: 


+ experienced kick-back in some shades, other shades had none at all 


+ experienced fall-out, the most being from matte shade 'Moonlit' 


🔸️COLOR-STORY CRITIQUE: 


+ this palette inholds the nice 'light-to-dark' gradient that I always look for. The included shades range from light to midtone to deep. There are quite a few options available to create depth in your look, which drastically improves a palette's versatility (i.e., the types/amount of varying looks you can create). 


+ there are two neutral 'transition shades' included in this particular color-story. 


+ the formula balance ratio in this palette is 14:6 (mattes to non-mattes), &amp; I think a 70% / 30% formula split shows that it's leaning heavily 'matte'. I prefer either completely balanced layouts, OR matte-heavy. 


+ I classify this as a mix-toned (warm &amp; cool) palette, &amp; I don't have another palette like this in my collection. 


+ there IS a matte black in this palette. I generally enjoy seeing a matte black included in a color-story - as it deems any palette truly 'universal'. 


+ throughout exploring this palette, I didn't encounter any 'dud' shades. 


🔸️FORMULA EVALUATION: 

//

+ | MATTES |: 

• this is one of my favorite matte formulations, if not THE favorite 

• each one is soft and has the same consistency across the board

• it's perfect for gradients &amp; layering

• they are absolutely true-to-tone

• there was no issue trying to build them to achieve maximum potential 

• this is a more 'directly-pigmented' formula (in lieu of being 'buildable'), making it slightly more difficult to manage and control. 

//

+ | METALLICS |: 

• these metallics are very smooshy and putty-like

• each one has a base pigment, making them multifunctional 

• these apply like foiled shades

• works perfectly with a dry brush

//

+ | MATTE BLACK |: 

• fully and completely matte in formulation

• extra pigmented 

• provides an astronomical amount of depth

• remains consistent with the formula in its ability to easily blend out

......

🔸️PACKAGING: 


+ The exterior cover design/art matches the interior color-story quite well, and is on-theme with the palette's name. 


+ I think this packaging is a great representation of the brand (Beauty Bay), as it's inline with several other products in this range.

......

🔸️RECOMMENDATION: I thought an actual 'sunset eye' would be a great representation of this palette's versatility. I used both warm &amp; cool tones, and I LOVED it. Every time Beauty Bay releases one of these 20-pan palettes, I always get excited to add it to my collection! This palette was MOST DEFINITELY on par as to their usual hit formula, and nothing disappointed me at ALL. I see tons of different potential looks in this color-story, too. I just love everything about it and I'm incredibly happy to have it!

......

▪️FINAL CONCLUSION: (recommend)

+ very easy to work with

+ incomparable matte formula

+ foiled-looking metallics work with a DRY brush

......

+ Favorite Shade: Mirage

- Least Favorite Shade: Shell

......

Makeup,"CC cream?I'm interested in buying the It Cosmetic CC Cream and see if I could use it as a foundation alternative, at least temporarily. My biggest problem is redness and five o'clock shadow, so I'm assuming a color correcting cream would really help with that. But I have a few questions:  


1. Do I still need to prime before applying the cream?
2. Do I need to color correct prior to putting on the cream?
3. Can I apply all the other makeup products (i.e. concealer, any powders, liquid blush, etc.)

Makeup,"Tell me all about your HG foundationFirst and most importantly, I have dry skin.

I ran out of foundation this week and all my ""backups"" are terrible in one way or another (too dark, too siliconey and doesn't play nice with my SPF, too warm). The concealer I've been wearing is also not the right color match but I've been using it up anyway.

I am ready for a higher-end foundation (and optional concealer). Please sell me on yours. Should I try Chanel? Estee Lauder? Dior? Armani? Does Fenty blow all those old brands out of the water? Is Gucci's newish line getting everything right? I haven't bought skin-color makeup in a long time so let me know!

For concealers - I don't bother covering spots, blemishes, imperfections, I am purely an under-eye gal, and it's a heavy life - I have deep teat troughs (genetic) and occasionally, allergic shiners. I've had success with Nars and Maybelline but I am not married to either. I once tried YSL but hated the shimmer to it, and I know people love the cle de peau concealer but I found it too dry when I tried it years ago.

Makeup,"Any dermatologists want to explain if pairing Ilia True Skin foundation and concealer is bad?The ilia true skin foundation contains niacinamide and claims to “visibly improve skin with every wear, minimizing the look of pores, lines, redness, and uneven tone instantly and over time.” 

The true skin concealer contains vitamin C and states that it can “help to improve skin over time, promoting a brighter, smoother, and more even complexion while helping to protect against environmental damage.”

After suffering from acne for over a decade, I have been very strict with my skincare regime and have seen fantastic results. That being said, I’m extremely cautious with what products I use and always confirm that products I use are compatible with each other. I was under the impression that niacinamide and vitamin c should not be combined with each other as they can significantly diminish the potency of one another.

Makeup,Looking for a primer!Hi everyone! I’m currently looking for a primer to pair with my foundation Nars radiant long wear. By itself the foundation is great and works well! But I would love just a little something more to make my application or face look a little more flawless. My skin type is oily with a few dry spots here and there but most oily. I also usually use cream products on top of my foundation for blush or contour (not too sure if this info is need).,"['Looking', 'for', 'primer', 'Hi', 'everyone', 'currently', 'looking', 'for', 'primer', 'to', 'pair', 'with', 'my', 'foundation', 'Nars', 'radiant', 'long', 'wear', 'By', 'itself', 'the', 'foundation', 'is', 'great', 'and', 'works', 'well', 'But', 'would', 'love', 'just', 'little', 'something', 'more', 'to', 'make', 'my', 'application', 'or', 'face', 'look', 'little', 'more', 'flawless', 'My', 'skin', 'type', 'is', 'oily', 'with', 'few', 'dry', 'spots', 'here', 'and', 'there', 'but', 'most', 'oily', 'also', 'usually', 'use', 'cream', 'products', 'on', 'top', 'of', 'my', 'foundation', 'for', 'blush', 'or', 'contour', 'not', 'too', 'sure', 'if', 'this', 'info', 'is', 'need']",looking for primer hi everyone currently looking for primer to pair with my foundation nars radiant long wear by itself the foundation is great and work well but would love just little something more to make my application or face look little more flawless my skin type is oily with few dry spot here and there but most oily also usually use cream product on top of my foundation for blush or contour not too sure if this info is need

Makeup,"Looking for a replacement for a discontinued tinted face balm from Bobbi BrownMy wife received some as a gift a while back, and said that it was absolutely the best thing she’s ever found for her face in her life.

It’s called Extra SPF 25 Tinted Moisturizing Balm.  She had the light tint.

Makeup,"Eye shadow routine advice for Mature SkinHey everybody !

This afternoon, I’m taking the mother in law to Sephora. She wants to start using eye shadow and I am so happy to be involved in this journey. 

She felt in love with Too Faced when she saw the Natural Matte Eyeshadow Palette I received for Christmas. 

She is 70 and has a beautiful skin with some wrinkles on the lids. She doesn’t seem to have dry or oily skin. Doesn’t matter here but she’s the best and I really like her.

My questions :

- Does she HAVE to use a primer ? If so, could you recommend a product or a type of product ?

- Does she have to set the primer and the eyeshadow ? If so, could you recommend a product or a type of product ?

- Is there a particular type of eyeshadow she should use or avoid ?

- Any routine advice welcome.

Makeup,"What products should I use if my eyelashes are falling?Okay so, I've always had naturally strong and nice lashes, but when I put on makeup, I want to highlight them more with mascara. I like how I look with it, it gives me a little more confidence, but after a few days of using it, my eyelashes start to thin, and I don't know why, or how to prevent that!

I used to use a nivea eye makeup remover, but it irritated my eyes, so I stopped. After that I stopped using mascara too, for a few months, and I used a serum to recover my eyelashes. They recovered well, and I still had my mascara from before, so last week I tried to use it again, but after like 3-4 days, my eyelashes started to thin again. I did my usual makeup and skin care routine, the only difference is that I didn't use eye makeup remover, I just used my regular face wash and cremes to clean and hydrate. I read somewhere that a lot of people use the serum I used as a primer before applying mascara, so I tried that too, thinking that it might help, but it didn't. 

I don't understand, am I allergic to eye makeup? My eyes did become red and irritated from the nivea product apart from the thinning, but now I don't have any of those symptoms, just the thinning. Do I use a bad mascara? How do I know which products are safe(er), and could you recommend me some?

Makeup,"Going to Disneyland! Need help on how to make it last the whole day!Hello! I’m going to Disneyland, Disney California Adventure, Universal Studios, and going to hit the beaches during the last 2 weeks of April. It’s my first time in the US so I want to look my very best for any photo opportunities. So yes, I need help on how to beat my face and make it smudge-proof, sweat-proof, heat-proof, water-proof, etc. Whatever will help keep it on my face for a good 15-18 hours! I’m only a beginner so I only have the basic things like blush, eyeshadow, lipstick, and concealer. 

So my problem is that my skin has not been looking it’s best. I have hyperpigmentation spots from acne scars on different parts of my face. It’s the main thing I would like some help with. I usually reapply my concealer (I have dry-oily skin combo) when I’m out. In this case, I’m not sure I want to keep reapplying every hour or whenever I wipe sweat off my face. I’m also not out for too long that my eyeshadow moves around. I’m nervous that I’ll be more concerned with how I look than enjoy myself.

Anyway, backstory over, here are my burning questions!

How do you keep your concealer on for hot and sweaty days? What are your concealer recommendations? No foundation recommendations please! (I’m foundation-free! And I’m afraid product will transfer to the mask) Do I still need primer? Powder? Will setting spray help? Is concealer just as good as eye primer?? (Which brands if you can specify since I don’t have any of these products) Which sunscreen can I use to apply and re-apply OVER my makeup on these sweaty days? 

I know there are a lot of questions but I’m grateful for any tips, tricks, and recommendations even if it’s just to answer one question or just a brand recommendation!

My question isn’t limited to just hyperpigmentation issue/concealer so feel free to add in tips to make lips, cheeks, eyeliner, eyebrows, and everything else last! 

This is my first time posting on Reddit so I hope I can get some of my burning questions answered!

Makeup,"Going to Disneyland! Need makeup tips on how to make it last the whole day!Hello! I’m going to Disneyland, Disney California Adventure, Universal Studios, and going to hit the beaches during the last 2 weeks of April. It’s my first time in the US so I want to look my very best for any photo opportunities. So yes, I need help on how to beat my face and make it smudge-proof, sweat-proof, heat-proof, water-proof, etc. Whatever will help keep it on my face for a good 15-18 hours! I’m only a beginner so I only have the basic things like blush, eyeshadow, lipstick, and concealer. 

So my problem is that my skin has not been looking it’s best. I have hyperpigmentation spots from acne scars on different parts of my face. It’s the main thing I would like some help with. I usually reapply my concealer (I have dry-oily skin combo) when I’m out. In this case, I’m not sure I want to keep reapplying every hour or whenever I wipe sweat off my face. I’m also not out for too long that my eyeshadow moves around. I’m nervous that I’ll be more concerned with how I look than enjoy myself.

Anyway, backstory over, here are my burning questions!

How do you keep your concealer on for hot and sweaty days? What are your concealer recommendations? No foundation recommendations please! (I’m foundation-free! And I’m afraid product will transfer to the mask) Do I still need primer? Powder? Will setting spray help? Is concealer just as good as eye primer?? (Which brands if you can specify since I don’t have any of these products) Which sunscreen can I use to apply and re-apply OVER my makeup on these sweaty days? 

I know there are a lot of questions but I’m grateful for any tips, tricks, and recommendations even if it’s just to answer one question or just a brand recommendation!

My question isn’t limited to just hyperpigmentation issue/concealer so feel free to add in tips to make lips, cheeks, eyeliner, eyebrows, and everything else last! 

This is my first time posting on Reddit so I hope I can get some of my burning questions answered!

......

🔹️ACQUIRED: received in an Ipsy: Glam Bag Plus, which I paid for myself 

......

❇ MY PREFERENCE (to combat bias):

▪️high-end, dry-formula, lengthening, volumizing, darkest black, natural-bristle, conical-shaped wand

.............................

TOTAL AVERAGE RATING: 4.1 / 5.0

......

ACTIVITY POTENTIALLY AFFECTING WEAR: throughout the entirety of the wear test - there was no crying, I didn't have watery eyes, I did have a vexing eye boogie attach itself to the very inner lash of my right eye (had to use my fingernail to remove), exposed lashes to harsh wind (rode with all the windows down at 78mph), I did a lot of physical activity today (causing my face to sweat)

......

Initial Application: (0800) feels completely weightless on the eyes, the style looks exactly the same on both sides (right side w/ curled lashes &amp; primer), wet formula, average black tone color, left eye side application mess (instant micro-flake speckles), gave me superb volume, great length, excellent curl and lift (even on the uncurled lash side), no clumping whatsoever, no 'spider lashes'. The wand is perfectly shaped and sized for the lower lashes.

......

🕑 2-Hour Mark: (1000) [still wearable] both sides holding original volume, lift, and curl.  The right eye (primed &amp; curled) is completely clean. The left eye has several flakes since application.

......

🕒 3-Hour Mark: (1100) [still wearable] looks the EXACT same as last check-in 

......

🕔 5-Hour Mark: (1300) [still wearable on right eye, subjectively wearable on left eye] both sides still maintaining original volume, lift, and curl. The right eye (primed and curled) looks to be in perfect condition. The left eye has even more severe flaking under the brow/on the upper eyelid area. There are no smudges on either side. 

......

🕗 8-Hour Mark: (1600) [still wearable on right eye, subjectively wearable on left eye] the lashes themselves look incredibly amazing - completely unchanged since application! The right eye (primed and curled) looks almost pristine, but I did notice two TINY flakes on the undereye area. The left eye is just flaking crazier by the hour. More flake particles have built up near the interior of the eye now. 

......

🧼 MICELLAR WATER TEST: fail; very difficult to remove with micellar water, recommend an oil-based remover for this one

......

+ 🤓 OVERALL REVIEW: 

//

+ FLAKING: flaking only essentially on left eye (eye sans primer), flaking noticed immediately at application 

•

+ TRANSFER/SMUDGING: no smudges or transfer at all
 
•

+ PACKAGING: slightly too lightweight, very on-brand color theming

•

+ BRUSH: so very easy to maneuver and get LITERALLY every single lash (even the tiniest ones), did not poke or stab me 

•

+ FORMULA: wet formula, weightless, not clumpy at all, lengthening, volumizing, and curling (kept this style ALL DAY)

•

+ VALUE: using the 'average' amount of mascara to be 0.27 fl oz &amp; $10, this particular tube has a higher-than-average fill at 0.33 fl oz, costing $25. So, for 0.06 fl oz of extra mascara product, you are paying a $4.55 premium. This mascara (in the standard size) would cost $20.45, making it an expensive product. 

♦️ PRICE PER 0.27 FL OZ SCALE:

&lt;$5=excellent; $6-$9=affordable; $10-$15=meh; $15-$30=expensive; &gt;$30=very expensive

•

+ BOTTOM-LASHES: no; brush is hard to maneuver for the lowers

•

+ RESULTS: the actual results coordination of this mascara worked perfectly with or without an additional lash primer. However, the use of a separate lash primer is necessary to prevent extensive flaking around the entire eye area - this mascara curls the lashes flawlessly without the use of a separate lash-curling tool - there was absolutely no smudging at all

•

+ RECOMMEND: yes; I think this mascara is good enough for an all-day, 8-hour wear WITH THE ADDED USE of a separate lash primer to keep the formula locked into place - if you are a person that does NOT like/want to use a lash primer, I do NOT recommend this formula - I must say I was QUITE impressed that the original volume, lift, and curl lasted ALL DAY LONG without touch-ups.

......

🚦RATING: B

A = totally wow'd me

B = not the best, but I like it

C = personal bias, nothing wrong w/ product

vexing eye boogie attach itself to the very inner lash of my right eye had to use my fingernail to remove exposed lash to harsh wind rode with all the window down at 78mph did lot of physical activity today causing my face to sweat initial application feel completely weightless on the eye the style look exactly the same on both side right side curled lash amp primer wet formula average black tone color left eye side application mess instant micro flake speckle gave me superb volume great length excellent curl and lift even on the uncurled lash side no clumping whatsoever no spider lash the wand is perfectly shaped and sized for the lower lash hour mark still wearable both side holding original volume lift and curl the right eye primed amp curled is completely clean the left eye ha several flake since application hour mark still wearable look the exact same a last check in hour mark still wearable on right eye subjectively wearable on left eye both side still maintaining original volume lift and curl the right eye primed and curled look to be in perfect condition the left eye ha even more severe flaking under the brow on the upper eyelid area there are no smudge on either side hour mark still wearable on right eye subjectively wearable on left eye the lash themselves look incredibly amazing completely unchanged since application the right eye primed and curled look almost pristine but did notice two tiny flake on the undereye area the left eye is just flaking crazier by the hour more flake particle have built up near the interior of the eye now micellar water test fail very difficult to remove with micellar water recommend an oil based remover for this one overall review flaking flaking only essentially on left eye eye sans primer flaking noticed immediately at application transfer smudging no smudge or transfer at all packaging slightly too lightweight very on brand color theming brush so very easy to maneuver and get literally every single lash even the tiniest one did not poke or stab me formula wet formula weightless not clumpy at all lengthening volumizing and curling kept this style all day value using the average amount of mascara to be fl oz amp this particular tube ha higher than average fill at fl oz costing so for fl oz of extra mascara product you are paying premium this mascara in the standard size would cost making it an expensive product price per fl oz scale lt excellent affordable meh expensive gt very expensive bottom lashes no brush is hard to maneuver for the lower results the actual result coordination of this mascara worked perfectly with or without an additional lash primer however the use of separate lash primer is necessary to prevent extensive flaking around the entire eye area this mascara curl the lash flawlessly without the use of separate lash curling tool there wa absolutely no smudging at all recommend yes think this mascara is good enough for an all day hour wear with the added use of separate lash primer to keep the formula locked into place if you are person that doe not like want to use lash primer do not recommend this formula must say wa quite impressed that the original volume lift and curl lasted all day long without touch ups rating rating legend totally wow me not the best but like it personal bias nothing wrong product this didn work out for me totally hate this
Makeup,"Morphe 35T Dope Taupe Palette - what's the deal with that one?asking all my beauty gurus/morphe fans/anyone who might be able to answer such an odd question -

I purchased it at t.j.maxx because it was a clearance steal. otherwise, it would've been a hard pass, I don't take chances buying any beauty products through TJX. I'm a mercari/posh seller, so I get home from the store and start doing a little research. normally what would do is go to the Morphe website, search the palette, and then read all about it so I can come up with my selling points. there's a reason I'm saying all the extra stuff I promise lol. 

&amp;#x200B;

i reach the website and that palette is NOWHERE to be found! I try Ulta, same. no results. 

the even stranger thing - Morphe's 35T is now the fairly new sweetest tea artistry palette. that boggled my mind, especially considering Morphe's eyeshadow palettes, big or small, almost always remain the same for years. esp the pan amount (35) &amp; whatever letter it may be for that palette. 

super curious if something went way wrong with this specific palette. I am not even positive what I mean by way wrong, but I just know something had to have happened, no?","['Morphe', '35T', 'Dope', 'Taupe', 'Palette', 'what', 'the', 'deal', 'with', 'that', 'one', 'asking', 'all', 'my', 'beauty', 'gurus', 'morphe', 'fans', 'anyone', 'who', 'might', 'be', 'able', 'to', 'answer', 'such', 'an', 'odd', 'question', 'purchased', 'it', 'at', 'maxx', 'because', 'it', 'was', 'clearance', 'steal', 'otherwise', 'it', 'would', 've', 'been', 'hard', 'pass', 'don', 'take', 'chances', 'buying', 'any', 'beauty', 'products', 'through', 'TJX', 'mercari', 'posh', 'seller', 'so', 'get', 'home', 'from', 'the', 'store', 'and', 'start', 'doing', 'little', 'research', 'normally', 'what', 'would', 'do', 'is', 'go', 'to', 'the', 'Morphe', 'website', 'search', 'the', 'palette', 'and', 'then', 'read', 'all', 'about', 'it', 'so', 'can', 'come', 'up', 'with', 'my', 'selling', 'points', 'there', 'reason', 'saying', 'all', 'the', 'extra', 'stuff', 'promise', 'lol', 'amp', 'x200B', 'reach', 'the', 'website', 'and', 'that', 'palette', 'is', 'NOWHERE', 'to', 'be', 'found', 'try', 'Ulta', 'same', 'no', 'results', 'the', 'even', 'stranger', 'thing', 'Morphe', '35T', 'is', 'now', 'the', 'fairly', 'new', 'sweetest', 'tea', 'artistry', 'palette', 'that', 'boggled', 'my', 'mind', 'especially', 'considering', 'Morphe', 'eyeshadow', 'palettes', 'big', 'or', 'small', 'almost', 'always', 'remain', 'the', 'same', 'for', 'years', 'esp', 'the', 'pan', 'amount', 'amp', 'whatever', 'letter', 'it', 'may', 'be', 'for', 'that', 'palette', 'super', 'curious', 'if', 'something', 'went', 'way', 'wrong', 'with', 'this', 'specific', 'palette', 'am', 'not', 'even', 'positive', 'what', 'mean', 'by', 'way', 'wrong', 'but', 'just', 'know', 'something', 'had', 'to', 'have', 'happened', 'no']",morphe 35t dope taupe palette what the deal with that one asking all my beauty guru morphe fan anyone who might be able to answer such an odd question purchased it at maxx because it wa clearance steal otherwise it would ve been hard pas don take chance buying any beauty product through tjx mercari posh seller so get home from the store and start doing little research normally what would do is go to the morphe website search the palette and then read all about it so can come up with my selling point there reason saying all the extra stuff promise lol amp x200b reach the website and that palette is nowhere to be found try ulta same no result the even stranger thing morphe 35t is now the fairly new sweetest tea artistry palette that boggled my mind especially considering morphe eyeshadow palette big or small almost always remain the same for year esp the pan amount amp whatever letter it may be for that palette super curious if something went way wrong with this specific palette am not even positive what mean by way wrong but just know something had to have happened no

Makeup,"TIPS from Korean dermatologist 2Hi guys, thought the previous post “ [TIPS from Korean dermatologist](https://www.reddit.com/r/Makeup/comments/taskyp/tips_from_korean_dermatologist/) “ went quite well, and today, I came up with another at home skin care tip.

&amp;#x200B;

Before I give you some tips, ‘everyone has their own allergies and problems including different conditions’. Please make sure that these are ‘tips’, not ‘prescriptions’.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, these are some tips from my friend who works in Korea dermatology

&amp;#x200B;

Trade secrets are never known to normal customers. They treat this way for VIPs only, and a one-time customer would never get to know this way. The most common example is the ‘Idol inner light skin care’. The reason why we think those celebrities are so different is because their skin glows very naturally. A normal one-time customer may be treated with a hydro injector. TBH, I don’t really recommend doing this, cause they might leave an injection mark, also it is temporary.

&amp;#x200B;

Just go grab a facial mask sheet (it’s like $10 for 100 pieces), and soak it with water type toner, put it on to your skin for 1minute, don’t leave the mask, pour 2 pumpings of ample ON to the mask ( one pumping for each cheek) and leave it for 2 minutes (3minutes total).

&amp;#x200B;

Celebrities sleep very less and if their skin is dried, there is a high possibility of using this method. 

&amp;#x200B;

And one important things, you need to use an ample which contains less water, for things like ‘ECLADO respiration ample’, ‘ESTEE LAUDER advanced night repair’, which most dermatologists in Korea use. I am currently using ‘COMPLETONE Chaga Charging drop’, which works the same. 

&amp;#x200B;

Treat this way twice every week, and it will help your skin glow naturally, no need to go to dermatology to spend a few hundred dollars.

&amp;#x200B;

So to sum up:

&amp;#x200B;

Buy a dried facial mask sheet and soak it with less-water toner, put it on your skin.

After a minute, pour two pumps of less-water ample on to the mask for two minutes

Done.

&amp;#x200B;

**Recommended products**: ECLADO respiration ample, ESTEE LAUDER advanced night repair, COMPLETONE Chaga Charging drop","['TIPS', 'from', 'Korean', 'dermatologist', '2Hi', 'guys', 'thought', 'the',

Makeup,"Foundation rubs off, and I think I know why now. Can someone please check my process/revised process?Hey everyone, I have always had a problem with foundation rubbing off onto clothes and I think I finally learned why. I’m going to outline my regular process, and a revised process, so I’d love some feedback to see if I’m on the right track!

Current foundation process:

-	Primer
-	color corrector (I’m genderfluid, so I use a fair amount to cover my beard shadow)
-	setting powder
-	foundation + concealer
-	setting powder

I believe the issue is the first coating of powder to set the color corrector, so, with that in mind...

New process:

-	primer
-	color corrector
-	setting SPRAY
-	foundation + concealer
-	setting powder

Does this sound right? Also I am checking all my products to make sure they all have matching bases (water, silicone etc), as I just learned that is a thing as well.

Makeup,"Waterproof liquid black eyeliner that stays AND is highly pigmented?Hi! I started using eyeliner a few months ago and at first tried two from Maybelline (the regular version and also the Tattoo Studio one), which both had a good rich color but don't stay that well on my eyelids.

Makeup,"I need help with foundation 🥺**Hey everyone! I’m not that great with makeup.** Some days its good and I’ll go out with it, but other times I take it off first. I really want to be better at it, but I can’t seem to figure out where I’m going wrong. Its not always like this, but my foundation seems to crack (?) most of the time. I don’t know if its because of mismatched ingredients like silicone+water (idk how to read the ingredients), or if I have dry/dehydrated/oily skin 😮‍💨  It makes me feel really insecure when this happens -even waterproof mascara always slips off.

* Foundation: Maybelline - Fit Me! Matte + poreless  
Top ingredients: Water, cyclohexasiloxane, nylon-12, isododecane, alcohol denat …
* Primer: Nyx - Honey Dew Me Up  
Top ingredients: Water, glycerin, alcohol denat, betaine, rosa centifolia extract ...

I put some foundation on to show you guys: [https://imgur.com/a/S3DYQmn](https://imgur.com/a/S3DYQmn) (embarrasing). It looks the same when I use sponge and brush. One time it looked *really* good when I used my fingers but it only worked out that one time hahahah. I exfoliate once a week.

I’ve never had anyone to talk to about makeup or really ask questions. I grew up with my dad and brother since turning 15 (after losing mom), and the majority of my friends that I grew are all boys or don’t like makeup haha. For a long time it was embarrassing for me to admit that I wanted to do makeup bc I was surrounded by boys with opinions! Which is silly, I know. I watch a ton of yt videos but it doesnt really stick in my head.

My mom absolutely loved makeup, and doing it is something that reminds me of her, so I really want to get better at it!","['need', 'help', 'with', 'foundation', 'Hey', 'everyone', 'not', 'that', 'great', 'with', 'makeup', 'Some', 'days', 'its', 'good', 'and', 'll', 'go', 'out', 'with', 'it', 'but', 'other', 'times', 'take', 'it', 'off', 'first', 'really', 'want', 'to', 'be', 'better', 'at', 'it', 'but', 'can', 'seem', 'to', 'figure', 'out', 'where', 'going', 'wrong', 'Its', 'not', 'always', 'like', 'this', 'but', 'my', 'foundation', 'seems', 'to', 'crack', 'most', 'of', 'the', 'time', 'don', 'know', 'if', 'its', 'because', 'of', 'mismatched', 'ingredients', 'like', 'silicone', 'water', 'idk', 'how', 'to', 'read', 'the', 'ingredients', 'or', 'if', 'have', 'dry', 'dehydrated', 'oily', 'skin', 'It', 'makes', 'me', 'feel', 'really', 'insecure', 'when', 'this', 'happens', 'even', 'waterproof', 'mascara', 'always', 'slips', 'off', 'Foundation', 'Maybelline', 'Fit', 'Me', 'Matte', 'poreless', 'Top', 'ingredients', 'Water', 'cyclohexasiloxane', 'nylon', 'isododecane', 'alcohol', 'denat', 'Primer', 'Nyx', 'Honey', 'Dew', 'Me', 'Up', 'Top', 'ingredients', 'Water', 'glycerin', 'alcohol', 'denat', 'betaine', 'rosa', 'centifolia', 'extract', 'put', 'some', 'foundation', 'on', 'to', 'show', 'you', 'guys', 'https', 'imgur', 'com', 'S3DYQmn', 'https', 'imgur', 'com', 'S3DYQmn', 'embarrasing', 'It', 'looks', 'the', 'same', 'when', 'use', 'sponge', 'and', 'brush', 'One', 'time', 'it', 'looked', 'really', 'good', 'when', 'used', 'my', 'fingers', 'but', 'it', 'only', 'worked', 'out', 'that', 'one', 'time', 'hahahah', 'exfoliate', 'once', 'week', 've', 'never', 'had', 'anyone', 'to', 'talk', 'to', 'about', 'makeup', 'or', 'really', 'ask', 'questions', 'grew', 'up', 'with', 'my', 'dad', 'and', 'brother', 'since', 'turning', 'after', 'losing', 'mom', 'and', 'the', 'majority', 'of', 'my', 'friends', 'that', 'grew', 'are', 'all', 'boys', 'or', 'don', 'like', 'makeup', 'haha', 'For', 'long', 'time', 'it', 'was', 'embarrassing', 'for', 'me', 'to', 'admit', 'that', 'wanted', 'to', 'do', 'makeup', 'bc', 'was', 'surrounded', 'by', 'boys', 'with', 'opinions', 'Which', 'is', 'silly', 'know', 'watch', 'ton', 'of', 'yt', 'videos', 'but', 'it', 'doesnt', 'really', 'stick', 'in', 'my', 'head', 'My', 'mom', 'absolutely', 'loved', 'makeup', 'and', 'doing', 'it', 'is', 'something', 'that', 'reminds', 'me', 'of', 'her', 'so', 'really', 'want', 'to', 'get', 'better', 'at', 'it']",need help with foundation hey everyone not that great with makeup some day it good and ll go out with it but other time take it off first really want to be better at it but can seem to figure out where going wrong its not always like this but my foundation seems to crack most of the time don know if it because of mismatched ingredient like silicone water idk how to read the ingredient or if have dry dehydrated oily skin it make me feel really insecure when this happens even waterproof mascara always slip off foundation maybelline fit me matte poreless top ingredient water cyclohexasiloxane nylon isododecane alcohol denat primer nyx honey dew me up top ingredient water glycerin alcohol denat betaine rosa centifolia extract put some foundation on to show you guy http imgur com s3dyqmn http imgur com s3dyqmn embarrasing it look the same when use sponge and brush one time it looked really good when used my finger but it only worked out that one time hahahah exfoliate once week ve never had anyone to talk to about makeup or really ask question grew up with my dad and brother since turning after losing mom and the majority of my friend that grew are all boy or don like makeup haha for long time it wa embarrassing for me to admit that wanted to do makeup bc wa surrounded by boy with opinion which is silly know watch ton of yt video but it doesnt really stick in my head my mom absolutely loved makeup and doing it is something that reminds me of her so really want to get better at it

Makeup,"Eyeliner and Lipstick HelpI'm just starting to get into makeup as a teenager, and I've learned a few things, one being that I look fantastic in eyeliner and I love wearing it. The only issue is that it takes me so so long to get it steady. I have kinda shaky hands, and I fixate on my eyeliner if it's not *exactly* even. But the thing is that it can take me over a half hour of fixing and reapplying to get it steady. I also use Q-Tips to steady it out but sometimes it'll take too much off and then I have to put it on again. It's really annoying to have to cut out a half hour time frame in my morning to apply it. I don't think that I need more practice since there was an entire semester of school that I wore eyeliner almost every day, and it still took me at least 20 minutes each time. How long does it normally take to apply eyeliner? And is there anything I can do to cut down the time? 

&amp;#x200B;

Another issue that I have is that my eyeliner is prone to flaking. I'm not sure why, and it happens even with a brand new container. My skin is rather dry, but that's more around my nose and forehead not my eyelids. Should I be moisturizing my eyelids?? Is it maybe that I'm not using the right eyeliner?

&amp;#x200B;

Also, I would really appreciate it if someone could give me lipstick recommendations. Are there any colors that look good with paler tones, and an olive undertone? I haven't really tried wearing it before because I have braces at the moment and I feel like it highlights the braces instead of emphasizing my lips at all. I don't want anything too neon pink at all, but just like specific shades would be helpful. I'm getting my braces off soon and I really want to try wearing some.","['Eyeliner', 'and', 'Lipstick', 'HelpI', 'just', 'starting', 'to', 'get', 'into', 'makeup', 'as', 'teenager', 'and', 've', 'learned', 'few', 'things', 'one', 'being', 'that', 'look', 'fantastic', 'in', 'eyeliner', 'and', 'love', 'wearing', 'it', 'The', 'only', 'issue', 'is', 'that', 'it', 'takes', 'me', 'so', 'so', 'long', 'to', 'get', 'it', 'steady', 'have', 'kinda', 'shaky', 'hands', 'and', 'fixate', 'on', 'my', 'eyeliner', 'if', 'it', 'not', 'exactly', 'even', 'But', 'the', 'thing', 'is', 'that', 'it', 'can', 'take', 'me', 'over', 'half', 'hour', 'of', 'fixing', 'and', 'reapplying', 'to', 'get', 'it', 'steady', 'also', 'use', 'Tips', 'to', 'steady', 'it', 'out', 'but', 'sometimes', 'it', 'll', 'take', 'too', 'much', 'off', 'and', 'then', 'have', 'to', 'put', 'it', 'on', 'again', 'It', 'really', 'annoying', 'to', 'have', 'to', 'cut', 'out', 'half', 'hour', 'time', 'frame', 'in', 'my', 'morning', 'to', 'apply', 'it', 'don', 'think', 'that', 'need', 'more', 'practice', 'since', 'there', 'was', 'an', 'entire', 'semester', 'of', 'school', 'that', 'wore', 'eyeliner', 'almost', 'every', 'day', 'and', 'it', 'still', 'took', 'me', 'at', 'least', 'minutes', 'each', 'time', 'How', 'long', 'does', 'it', 'normally', 'take', 'to', 'apply', 'eyeliner', 'And', 'is', 'there', 'anything', 'can', 'do', 'to', 'cut', 'down', 'the', 'time', 'amp', 'x200B', 'Another', 'issue', 'that', 'have', 'is', 'that', 'my', 'eyeliner', 'is', 'prone', 'to', 'flaking', 'not', 'sure', 'why', 'and', 'it', 'happens', 'even', 'with', 'brand', 'new', 'container', 'My', 'skin', 'is', 'rather', 'dry', 'but', 'that', 'more', 'around', 'my', 'nose', 'and', 'forehead', 'not', 'my', 'eyelids', 'Should', 'be', 'moisturizing', 'my', 'eyelids', 'Is', 'it', 'maybe', 'that', 'not', 'using', 'the', 'right', 'eyeliner', 'amp', 'x200B', 'Also', 'would', 'really', 'appreciate', 'it', 'if', 'someone', 'could', 'give', 'me', 'lipstick', 'recommendations', 'Are', 'there', 'any', 'colors', 'that', 'look', 'good', 'with', 'paler', 'tones', 'and', 'an', 'olive', 'undertone', 'haven', 'really', 'tried', 'wearing', 'it', 'before', 'because', 'have', 'braces', 'at', 'the', 'moment', 'and', 'feel', 'like', 'it', 'highlights', 'the', 'braces', 'instead', 'of', 'emphasizing', 'my', 'lips', 'at', 'all', 'don', 'want', 'anything', 'too', 'neon', 'pink', 'at', 'all', 'but', 'just', 'like', 'specific', 'shades', 'would', 'be', 'helpful', 'getting', 'my', 'braces', 'off', 'soon', 'and', 'really', 'want', 'to', 'try', 'wearing', 'some']",eyeliner and lipstick helpi just starting to get into makeup a teenager and ve learned few thing one being that look fantastic in eyeliner and love wearing it the only issue is that it take me so so long to get it steady have kinda shaky hand and fixate on my eyeliner if it not exactly even but the thing is that it can take me over half hour of fixing and reapplying to get it steady also use tips to steady it out but sometimes it ll take too much off and then have to put it on again it really annoying to have to cut out half hour time frame in my morning to apply it don think that need more practice since there wa an entire semester of school that wore eyeliner almost every day and it still took me at least minute each time how long doe it normally take to apply eyeliner and is there anything can do to cut down the time amp x200b another issue that have is that my eyeliner is prone to flaking not sure why and it happens even with brand new container my skin is rather dry but that more around my nose and forehead not my eyelid should be moisturizing my eyelid is it maybe that not using the right eyeliner amp x200b also would really appreciate it if someone could give me lipstick recommendation are there any color that look good with paler tone and an olive undertone haven really tried wearing it before because have brace at the moment and feel like it highlight the brace instead of emphasizing my lip at all don want anything too neon pink at all but just like specific shade would be helpful getting my brace off soon and really want to try wearing some

I follow it with cream blush and contour and powdered highlight.","['Water', 'based', 'moisturizer', 'and', 'silicone', 'primer', 'hadn', 'really', 'thought', 'about', 'this', 'before', 'but', 'if', 'you', 'use', 'water', 'based', 'gel', 'moisturizer', 'like', 'the', 'peach', 'and', 'lily', 'gel', 'moisturizer', 'would', 'it', 'cause', 'problems', 'with', 'your', 'silicone', 'makeup', 'routine', 'use', 'the', 'YSL', 'primer', 'which', 'seems', 'to', 'be', 'oil', 'based', 'when', 'looking', 'at', 'the', 'ingredients', 'Correct', 'me', 'if', 'wrong', 'Then', 'use', 'the', 'Nars', 'Radiant', 'Longwear', 'Foundation', 'follow', 'it', 'with', 'cream', 'blush', 'and', 'contour', 'and', 'powdered', 'highlight']",water based moisturizer and silicone primer hadn really thought about this before but if you use water based gel moisturizer like the peach and lily gel moisturizer would it cause problem with your silicone makeup routine use the ysl primer which seems to be oil based when looking at the ingredient correct me if wrong then use the nars radiant longwear foundation follow it with cream blush and contour and powdered highlight
Makeup,"light coverage base helpHey everyone so am currently wearing elf camo concealer for my eyes and a little on my face as I like a super light natural look, when I go for a foundation product I use cc cream from elf. But I was wondering if there a nice light tint that would just smooth over my skin. Many tint wash me out and have very limited shades so any advice for a super light coverage base would be fantasic. I did use ultra sun tinted sunscreen but agian the shade was off and they only had a few shades. 

Any advice would be appreciated thanks x","['light', 'coverage', 'base', 'helpHey', 'everyone', 'so', 'am', 'currently', 'wearing', 'elf', 'camo', 'concealer', 'for', 'my', 'eyes', 'and', 'little', 'on', 'my', 'face', 'as', 'like', 'super', 'light', 'natural', 'look', 'when', 'go', 'for', 'foundation', 'product', 'use', 'cc', 'cream', 'from', 'elf', 'But', 'was', 'wondering', 'if', 'there', 'nice', 'light', 'tint', 'that', 'would', 'just', 'smooth', 'over', 'my', 'skin', 'Many', 'tint', 'wash', 'me', 'out', 'and', 'have', 'very', 'limited', 'shades', 'so', 'any', 'advice', 'for', 'super', 'light', 'coverage', 'base', 'would', 'be', 'fantasic', 'did', 'use', 'ultra', 'sun', 'tinted', 'sunscreen', 'but', 'agian', 'the', 'shade', 'was', 'off', 'and', 'they', 'only', 'had', 'few', 'shades', 'Any', 'advice', 'would', 'be', 'appreciated', 'thanks']",light coverage base helphey everyone so am currently wearing elf camo concealer for my eye and little on my face a like super light natural look when go for foundation product use cc cream from elf but wa wondering if there nice light tint that would just smooth over my skin many tint wash me out and have very limited shade so any advice for super light coverage base would be fantasic did use ultra sun tinted sunscreen but agian the shade wa off and they only had few shade any advice would be appreciated thanks
