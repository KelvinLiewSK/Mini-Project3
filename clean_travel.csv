travel,"DE - JP *Tax duty? *Hello everyone, I am currently planning to go on a vacation to Tokyo, Japan. I will most likely focus on Tokyo itself. I truly enjoy this place and can't wait to be there. Next to visiting museums, eating and checking out this beautiful place I am planning on shopping there (just for myself). I'd like to buy a wide array on items, especially designer clothing, good skincare, maybe perfumes as well as stationary items and merchandise.

I am coming from Germany and all of this stuff is for myself. Are there any regulations on these items and what about the taxes? Especially when it comes to designer clothing as they can be quite expensive.

Thank you in advance!

travel,"Anyone else get anxious about not being able to go to their bucket list places in their lifetime?Delete if not allowed. I don’t even know if this makes sense but I wanted to see if anyone else feels the same as I do.

I’m 25F and LOVE travel. It’s one of my biggest passions. Ever since I was a kid, I used to watch the Travel Channel and made a list of the places I wanted to see in my lifetime. So far I’ve been to about 12 countries which doesn’t even skim the full list of places I’d like to visit. 

Lately I’ve been feeling really anxious and restless about never getting the chance to travel to everywhere I want to go before I die. I lost 2 years of travel due to the pandemic and in 5-6 years, my fiancé and I want to start a family. This makes me feel like I only have 5-6 years to really get to travel without worrying about kids or other major responsibilities and getting actually serious about life. My fiancé unfortunately only has 15 PTO days right now (I have unlimited) and we don’t have unlimited money so that obviously doesn’t let us travel like 2 months out of the year.

travel,"Suggestions on where to go for end of Europe trip in early June?We’ll be flying in and out of Amsterdam. So far the plan is to go spend 4 nights in Amsterdam then a few nights in Florence followed by 2-3 nights in Cinque Terre (we were in Florence a couple years ago and did a Cinque Terre day trip but I’ve always wanted to go back for longer). 

From there we’ll have about another 4-5 nights before we’ll need to get back to Amsterdam. We originally thought of going to Croatia but the lack of direct flights makes it a bit difficult. 

Right now one option is to go from cinque terre to Rome and fly from there to Nice (again a place we’ve been but for too short of a time).

We are staying near Placa de Catalunya and I am using Rick Steves Pocket Barcelona third edition as a guide. 

Day 1 - arrive around noon from an overnight flight. Go to the hotel, freshen up and head to the Picasso Museum for timed tickets in the afternoon. Walk around Gothic quarter 

Day 2 - Sagrada Familia in the morning and Montjuic Castle in the afternoon

Day 3 - Montserrat all day - was planning on taking mass transit. Is that too aggressive or fairly easy?

Day 4 - Beach in the morning and walking tour in the afternoon

Day 5 - Breakfast and fly out

travel,"Summer travel inspiration, probably in the USA?Hi all! Sorry for the long post! Looking for some ideas for a summer trip, as the title says. Husband and I usually do a big international trip in the summer but have canceled the last couple of years due to you know what. We decided that with low(er) cases and being triple vaxxed that we'd get back out there this year and planned a trip to Italy. However, we have a 4 month old baby and with the mask mandates being lifted on flights, no longer feel comfortable taking her on a plane, especially if she will be unvaxxed at the time of the trip, which is looking increasingly likely.

We know what our risk tolerance is when it comes to the baby, so c*vid advice and opinions are not needed. =)

So, the backup plan! Driving somewhere seems like the safest and cheapest option. We will be setting out from central New Mexico.

For context: we are not resort people and $ is a factor. The baby does well in the car. We are willing to do a multi day drive if there are interesting things to do along the way. Camping is an option, although husband will appreciate some nights in a hotel, guesthouse, rental house, etc. We enjoy hiking, biking, breweries, wineries, occasional museums, and generally wandering around interesting places. We are open to more of a road trip with various stops or a trip where we drive to one place and stay put.

We like Mexico and considered that to get our international fix, but felt like anywhere close enough to drive, like Baja, would be too hot in June. We also considered somewhere like Banff but thought we might get burned out by the drive. 

We are planning about 3 weeks, in June. 

Some basic criteria  (OK if a place doesn't meet all of them) : less hot than NM, so not triple digits. Access to a cool town or city and nature/outside opportunities. Some sort of body of water is a bonus. Husband and I are an interracial couple (Black/white) so preferably no Deliverance vibes. National parks are cool if you know one that won't be overrun this summer and won't be crazy hot in June. 
 
So, does this place exist? Where have you been/where do you live that you would recommend to a stir crazy little family in desperate need of some c*vid-cautious adventures?","['Summer', 'travel', 'inspiration', 'probably',

travel,"Bulgaria 4 day itinerary and adviceHi.

I organized a 4 day Itinerary for Bulgaria, travelling with a rental car, changing lodging every night, as follows:

Day 1: Sofia (mainly city stuff, I got it figured)

Day 2: hiking Rila national park (the 7 lakes + musala etc.)

Day 3: hiking Pirin national park (vihren + kiterlo peaks + knocheto ridge etc.)

Day 4: spa in Bansko and make our way back to Sofia for a leisurely ending of the vacation, with some interesting stuff along the drive to Sofia.

Day 4 is where I need advice regarding the drive bacl to Sofia.
We can extend it by going first east to Trigrad, but it'll extend the driving portion from 2 hours to about 6!

Question is: are there any noteworthy stops you can suggest if we drove from Bansko more or less directly to Sofia while adding some detours that won't add more than 30-45 minutes to the total drive time?

travel,"Buying seats on the planeFor those of you who have travelled with friends or family, how often are you separated from them on the plane ?

I'm planning a trip with a friend for New York in October. It's a direct flight, and it should last 8hrs.

It's not my first time, but it's my friend's first time.

The companies I've looked at for tickets all give you the option to buy seats, but for 40€ per person for both flights, I'm not sure it's worth it.

Granted, it's a small sum but my friend is both very concerned with affordability and with being left to her own devices on the planes.

The last times I took a plane, I was with minors and thus allowed to sit next/near them enough to take care of them. 

I'm pretty sure I remember I can simply ask for us to be seated near each other, if not next to one another as I'm aware that it'd highly depend on seat availability. but I can't find any info to correlate my memories. 

So, am I having memory issues or is it something I can ask the plane staff ?","['Buying', 'seats', 'on', 'the', 'planeFor', 'those', 'of', 'you', 'who', 'have', 'travelled', 'with', 'friends', 'or', 'family', 'how', 'often', 'are', 'you', 'separated', 'from', 'them', 'on', 'the', 'plane', 'planning', 'trip', 'with', 'friend', 'for', 'New', 'York', 'in', 'October', 'It', 'direct', 'flight', 'and', 'it', 'should', 'last', '8hrs', 'It', 'not', 'my', 'first', 'time', 'but', 'it', 'my', 'friend', 'first', 'time', 'The', 'companies', 've', 'looked', 'at', 'for', 'tickets', 'all', 'give', 'you', 'the', 'option', 'to', 'buy', 'seats', 'but', 'for', 'per', 'person', 'for', 'both', 'flights', 'not', 'sure', 'it', 'worth', 'it', 'Granted', 'it', 'small', 'sum', 'but', 'my', 'friend', 'is', 'both', 'very', 'concerned', 'with', 'affordability', 'and', 'with', 'being', 'left', 'to', 'her', 'own', 'devices', 'on', 'the', 'planes', 'The', 'last', 'times', 'took', 'plane', 'was', 'with', 'minors', 'and', 'thus', 'allowed', 'to', 'sit', 'next', 'near', 'them', 'enough', 'to', 'take', 'care', 'of', 'them', 'pretty', 'sure', 'remember', 'can', 'simply', 'ask', 'for', 'us', 'to', 'be', 'seated', 'near', 'each', 'other', 'if', 'not', 'next', 'to', 'one', 'another', 'as', 'aware', 'that', 'it', 'highly', 'depend', 'on', 'seat', 'availability', 'but', 'can', 'find', 'any', 'info', 'to', 'correlate', 'my', 'memories', 'So', 'am', 'having', 'memory', 'issues', 'or', 'is', 'it', 'something', 'can', 'ask', 'the', 'plane', 'staff']",buying seat on the planefor those of you who have travelled with friend or family how often are you separated from them on the plane planning trip with friend for new york in october it direct flight and it should last 8hrs it not my first time but it my friend first time the company ve looked at for ticket all give you the option to buy seat but for per person for both flight not sure it worth it granted it small sum but my friend is both very concerned with affordability and with being left to her own device on the plane the last time took plane wa with minor and thus allowed to sit next near them enough to take care of them pretty sure remember can simply ask for u to be seated near each other if not next to one another a aware that it highly depend on seat availability but can find any info to correlate my memory so am having memory issue or is it something can ask the plane staff

travel,"First time travelling to TurkeyHello all! 

My friend and I will be coming to Turkey (istanbul) on the 13th of May, for touristic purposes. We will spend 7 days in Asian side and 3 days in European side, total of 10 days there, and we will leave on the 23rd of May. I plan to buy gifts (mostly average price, not designer things), visit monuments, and of course, eat. My friend and I booked hotels (we still haven't paid for hotel) and paid for flight. I was wondering, how much do you think each one of us should allocate as budget for 10 days? Our hotel costs 230 euros per person. would bringing a total of 1000 euros (Hotel + spendings/gifts and shopping) per person be enough?

travel,"Turkey Itinerary comparisonHi All  
I am touring Turkey for few days and in a dilemma to choose one of the two option below between these dates(30May - 3June).

&amp;#x200B;

 I fly from Istanbul and will reach Denizli/Antalya and between them I want to visit Pamukkaale and Olu Deniz (may be Kas)

Option 1 (By Bus)  
1) 30th May: Fly from Istanbul to Denizli  (Stay night in Denizli)  
2) 31st May : Visit Pamukkale , In evening catch bus to Olu deniz. Evening stay there

3) 1 June- Olu Deniz

4) 2 June - Either 1 more Day in Olu Deniz or take bus to Kas

5) 3 June- Leave for Antalya (Checking in Antalya in evening)  


Option 2 (By Car)  
1) 30th May: Fly from Istanbul to Antalya  (Stay night in Antalya)  
2) 31st May : Drive(3hr) to Pamukkale Visit Pamukkale ,Evening stay there

I read bus service is good but rental cars are also not very costly . I don't enjoy driving a lot but i see it will be 3hrs driving every day. If I take bus then some time will be wasted to identify which bus and from where?  


Since I am there in first week of June, I believe AC will be required. Do the bus have AC ?

travel,"Tipping wage workers cash is great and if more wage workers got tipped cash everyone would benefitWe all may know that we are supposed to report tips on our taxes, but let's face it, do we?  By this logic we should report every bicycle and bed frame we sell on Craigslist and everytime we pay our friends for picking up beer.  We don't.  Maybe some tips get reported, but rarely is it all of it.  This is the beauty of the cash tip, it is essentially tax-free.  It also nails down a bit more the lovely and isane ""trickle down economics theory"" (only a little bit) because those who can afford more, must now tip more.  That's money they do not get to write off taxes, and money you don't have to report on your taxes.  



But let's do some math, shall we?



Say you are a modestly paid fast food employee and like a good business you pool and split tips with everyone on shift at the location.  You make $15/hr and because tipping is now the norm, you get around $40 a night.  If you work an 8 hour shift that's $5/hr.  Tax the $15/hr at .78 = 11.7 ☹ but add the $5/hr you made $16.70/hr untaxed.  Nice.  Okay let's make ol Mr. Fastfood Employer raise the wage to $20/hr, cause ya know $15+$5 is $20 and now it's all taxed at .78= $15.60/hr.  Little Fastfood worker lost $1.10 an hour.  AND because employer had to raise wages, you guessed it, they raised prices.  

Standard markup on restaurant food is 300%.  That's right.. 3x the original cost of the food. So a $6 burger cost Fastfood™️ $2.  The goal of a restaurant is to keep labor and food cost under 60% of gross eaenings.  Say Fastfood™️ has 5 employees on a shift all making $15 for 8 hours, so labor cost is $600 a shift. To make enough to cover that by 40% thats, follow along, $1000, divided by $6 per burger, 166 burgers. But each burger cost $2, so now it's the $332 for burgers plus $600 for labor, it's $932, which is 60% of 1553, so 259 burgers.  But oh no those 259 cost $2.  I'll skip the hard part.  375 burgers grosses $2250, minus $750 cost of burger, $600 labor, you are now at $900, or 40%, your cost of labor and product is 60%.  Congrats.  Let's raise wages.  Because people heard your poor employees only made $15 an hour, so they got together to make sure they made $40 a shift each that's $200 total for the shift, that's tipping $0.53 per $6 burger, a whole 8.83%!!! What a world.  Okay, well Fastfood Employer knows the customer is always right, let's pay em $20 to keep the people happy.  So $800 per shift in labor.  Oh God here comes the burger math.  But wait.  If we were selling more burgers, we could have lowered prices years ago, no we sell 375 burgers per shift and that's why they cost $6.  It's simple economics.  Price reflects demand.  So now our labor+product cost is now $1550, 68% of gross earnings, too high for Fastfood™️, burgers cost more now.  We need to make $2583 to have that number drop back to 60%.  Burgers now cost $6....and 88 cents!!!! Wait a fucking minute that's more than we were tipping.  And oh snap the employees... pay taxes on the mother udder!!!  It's LOSE LOSE.  You were better off tipping!!! Everyone was!! You now pay 35 cents more and the employees make $1.10 less!!!! Better to stay tipping. 



But, but what if they don't do so well some nights and only sell 350 burgers or like on a really bad night only 200 burgers the employees are making less, it's not fair they should be compensated for their time!! .53 × 200 is only 106 ÷ 5 is only $21, $2.62 an hour, a total of $14.32 after regular taxed wage, $1.30 less than if they just always made $20.  Yes.  Sales sucks because of this, you may have those bad days.  But if 200 burgers were the norm, prices would raise(doubtful) someone would get fired(probable), Fastfood™️ would do something to reflect this number.  Most restaurants will let a staff member go for the shift if sales are slow.  But heck, they could stay and still make a wage comparable to what they were making while the restaurant takes the hit.  And if the fluctuations could be this drastic, could there not be days where sales go up?  Say 450 sold, that's $47.7 per person, an extra $5.96/hr, $17.66/hr that shift and no prices raised to facilitate it.  


In the end, tipping is the best route because when the averages come in, its cheaper for everyone, due simply to taxes.","['Tipping', 'wage', 'workers', 'cash', 'is', 'great', 'and', 'if', 'more',

travel,"How many days do you need in Hawaii when traveling from U.S. east coast?More specifically, to Oahu. It’s my dream to visit Hawaii, but the biggest hold up is how long it takes to get there from the east coast. I would really only want to do a Friday through Saturday trip (8 days) so I wouldn’t miss too much work. What I would like to know is this worth the 14 ish hours of traveling each way, or would I be better off holding off until I could spend like two weeks there instead? Would I feel too rushed? I’m not interested in relaxing on beaches, more so the hiking and exploring just on Oahu.

I was getting some stuff at a vape shop I never went too and the dude showed me a pack that I didn't think was the right one so I told him ""are you sure this is the right thing?"" He replied by ""do you think I'm a fck idiot?"" As someone who has been around business for years I can tell you it is no way to talk to a customer in general in the first place, especially to someone that isn't from the country. I replied with a concerned face like ""excuse me? No? I'm just making sure cause it looks like the pack of the older version"" (I literally showed him what I needed) he proceeded to serve me very angrily ""well if it wasn't the right thing I would have gone in the drawer over there and picked it up for you"" he literally even went to the drawer to show me the other product angrily treating me like an idiot like I work there or something? So I got what I needed and then he proceeds to say ""are you American?"" I said ""no I'm from Canada"" so he says ""ok so near the states"" and I was like ""yeah Canada"" I really did wish I would have showed him my ID since I don't even have a white name (he believed I was over 18). There was an other customer waiting and the cashier told the other client ""Aah this guy from north America getting offended by everything, he's gonna learn"" they proceeded to literally laugh at my face just because I'm not from here and that he thought it was somehow professional/right the way he treated me?? Anyways the worst part is that minutes after I went out I was right he gave me the wrong thing and I had to go back to show him it was actually him in the wrong and he learned his lesson instead of me that should have according to him, honestly was hilarious in the end but I can't believe how some people seem to think that Canada is the same thing as the USA and that because Canada Is near the states we have the same mentality and it has happened to me many times being told ""oh same thing"" then they dare to say Americans are the ones that are dumb while they don't know a thing about

travel,"Do I have to book a round trip flight when travelling to the US for an extended period of time? (3-6 months)I'm planning on having an extended stay with some friends in the states, particularly California. I live in Canada (Ontario), and I was wondering if customs would turn me away or something if I only had a one way flight booked. I don't know exactly when I'll be returning, but it would be well within the timeframe that I am considered a visitor still. I heard that around the 3 month mark would be a good idea to contact the embassy for an extension if they are wanting me to come back then initially. The airline I use doesn't seem to allow refunds, so I don't want book a return flight and it turns out I'm not leaving then. That would be like 300-400 dollars down the drain.

We have in our plans to spend 2 nights in Hurghada as I spend a day diving. The other day will be lounging around the beach/resort and give us some nice lazy time before our trip really starts. 

Here comes the more difficult part of the trip to plan: seeing Luxor, Aswan and Abu Simbel. We were thinking about taking a GoBus from Hurghada to Luxor. Are there any companies you can refer us that can do multi day trips to Aswan and Abu Simbel then take us back to Luxor? 

From then, we’ll fly back to Cairo and spend the last few days there that may include a day trip to Alexandria.

We have heard great things about Lyon and that it’s hard to find a bad meal. I’m a lover of patisseries so this is very appealing to me. It also seems like a very easy city to spend three days as it’s easy to get around.

On the other hand, Nice makes more sense logistically as we would be coming from Moustiers-Saint-Marie. It also makes sense as we will already be in the south of France so why not spend a couple of days on the Côte d’Azur!

I am planning on travelling from La Paz, Bolivia to Sucre, Bolivia by plane. To my surprise, there's no direct flight and there are not that many connection.

One of the few connections that arrives at a good hour for me (early in the morning) is only 45 minutes long.

travel,"Cruises Suck - UPDATENot sure if anyways cares to read but I had a lot of good, reasonable responses in the last post and I thought I should update... I also thought some were quick to judge me based on what little information I gave you; some said I was an asshole or that I should be fortunate I can take two back to back vacations. We are on a travel subreddit, I work a small business that is very seasonal.  I take two vacations a year amounting to about 3 weeks. But hey, I was quick to make some judgements myself and I apologize for that, I hope some of you can understand  where I'm coming from.   I think for the people thinking about taking a cruise I feel like they deserve to see the whole picture instead of just my initial rant. For those wondering, this was (I'm sure you guessed it) a Carnival Cruise.

Here's the link to the original thread.
https://old.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/u6ype1/cruises_suck_never_again/

A couple quick things to clarify, I've been with my GF for 6 years and the ""Kids"" as I refer to them are actually 14-19 years old.   This was ""the family trip"" but they are not children by any stretch, we give them almost full independence on this trip.  They are young but dont exactly need any special catering or treatment. 

Anyways, as I said I'd like to apologize for acting like a judgmental jerk.  I think my initial frustration was thinking this trip would be different or better than my one and only cruise experience about 4 years ago.  In some ways it was better, in other ways it wasn't.  But after day 1 I felt like a fool for signing up for it once again, there were a lot of things that just reaffirmed my feelings and I let it overwhelm me.  Thats my problem.  I followed r/travel's advice not to let this bleed into our vacation, for the sake of the rest of the family, I never intended to, but your advice just made me more conscious.  I did have a discussion about my annoyances regarding the cruise with my GF once she brought up being frustrated herself with the crowds. 

Here are my takeaways - 

The Positives: 

1. The destinations:   The bahamian people were a lot of fun.  I enjoyed Nassau when many people on r/cruise, tripadvisor, etc called it the armpit of the Caribbean.  Half Moon Cay was a top 5 beach for me and Turks and Caicos was also a good time.

2.  The weather:  My previous cruise was a pacific mexican cruise which is colder.  What sold me on a Caribbean cruise was the warmer weather and ocean and it did not disappoint. 

3.  The staff:  I can't compliment them enough.  They work really hard to make things perfect for you.  We had issues which I'll delve into in the negatives but I dont place any blame on them.   They deserve better treatment for the work they do. 

The Meh's:

1. The Drinks:  Overall pretty good.   I never felt cheated on alcohol, and the higher end bars had some fun cocktails.  My only gripe is the cost at $12-$18 per cocktail.  

2. Entertainment:  The pools were very small and crowded for a ship of this size and quickly turned colors which is kind of gross.  The teens got in the pool I think just one time. I'm just not a fan of the theatre shows they had, I felt like I was just killing time. They weren't bad, but it was like watching an ok cover band.  The comedians were pretty good. The nightclub was weird...  all the chairs and tables faced the dance floor which I think scared everyone from getting out there to dance.  We danced anyways but there was never more than 8 people out there.  We picked this cruise because it was more friendly to kids and teens and they were all bored by day 3 lol.  I felt like we had more activities previous all-inclusives simply because there are less time and weather constraints.  It was frustrating when we wanted to dance to latin music the DJ was only slotted for 45 minutes. There are naturally limitations with a cruise ship.

The Negatives:

1. The people:  I'll start by saying I did meet some genuinely nice people, no they were not intrepid world travelers but they were nice.  I did meet some downright trashy and rude people though.  People berating workers over trivial things like not enough ice in their water, one man was genuinely upset and said he'd never go on a Carnival Cruise again because Guy Fieri's burger joint was only open on sea days.   Lots of politically conservative people (which is fine I dont care) who felt like it was appropriate to talk politics.  IDK... I just dont like to talk politics to strangers, particularly when travelling even if I generally agree with people.  One couple asked me why I haven't fled that ""hell-hole"" I live in (I'll let you guess the state) and when I told them it wasn't as bad as Fox News says, they had nothing more to talk about.  I also just felt like this was a bad representation of Americans.  There was a very obese man on his knee's fanning himself because the Nassau pier was too long of a walk.  It makes me sad that this how many Caribbean nations see Americans.

2. The Food:  Breakfast was consistently bad, and it was the same options every day.  Lunch was better and Dinner hit or miss.  The ""fun"" food options like Pizza and their poor excuse for mexican food were not good. Oh and Guy Fieri's burger was not good either. 

3.  The Service:  Like I said, I dont blame the workers... I can tell they are really trying hard but something was off, it just wasn't working, maybe there were short staffed idk.  It took 40 minutes to get a drink at dinner, one of the kids wanted a hot chocolate that took 40 minutes, almost an hour for a bagel.  Just a lot of random little things.  

4. The Pollution:  I know I know, all travelling is bad for the environment.  I can't deny it.  But Cruising is a double middle finger to planet earth.  People thought I was exaggerating about the black exhaust smoke but I wasn't, just look at the exhaust stack. When we left Miami there was a visible haze over the port area.  These engines run 24/7 and are less efficient than any other mode of transport.  Cruising is the ""rolling coal"" of vacation modes.  Just because other modes of transport are toxic doesn't give cruising a free pass, I wont budge from that.  I'm not an environmentalist by any stretch but it just felt obnoxiously bad.  Maybe someone can explain, but why are we not running these things with nuclear engines?

Overall Summary:

I get why some of you guys enjoy it but its not for me.  I feel like all-inclusives are better overall but to each their own.  I learned from my trip that it really is what you make of it.  I didnt sulk away in my cabin, I went out and looked for ways to have fun.  Alcohol and socializing helped.   When we asked the teens how they enjoyed it the results were mixed.  Fortunately for me, I think they would rather do a fixed destination next year.   Most of the negatives would have been alleviated with a higher end cruise, however this trip ended up costing about $7000... $2,523 for the cruise itself, $2000 roughly in taxes, fees, drinks and excursions, $2400ish in hotels, flights, parking etc. Not bad for a group of 6. But from what I gather they enjoyed some of our previous vacations more.  Holland America would have been $700 more for the same experience. Norwegian $2000 more and Princess would have been $4200 more.  Its clear I got what I paid for, but I'm skeptical we would have been happy spending $9,000-$10,000 on a trip. I can excuse a lot of things like food or inconveniences when traveling, I personally enjoy the unpredictability... but for this trip we were sold good food, good entertainment and good times and the results were mixed. In the end, the general consensus was that we all enjoyed our time off the ship more than on the ship.","['Cruises', 'Suck', 'UPDATENot', 'sure', 'if', 'anyways', 'cares', 'to', 'read', 'but', 'had',

care to read but had lot of good reasonable response in the last post and thought should update also thought some were quick to judge me based on what little information gave you some said wa an asshole or that should be fortunate can take two back to back vacation we are on travel subreddit work small business that is very seasonal take two vacation year amounting to about week but hey wa quick to make some judgement myself and apologize for that hope some of you can understand where coming from think for the people thinking about taking cruise feel like they deserve to see the whole picture instead of just my initial rant for those wondering this wa sure you guessed it carnival cruise here the link to the original thread http old reddit com travel comment u6ype cruises_suck_never_again couple quick thing to clarify ve been with my gf for year and the kids a refer to them are actually year old this wa the family trip but they are not child by any stretch we give them almost full independence on this trip they are young but dont exactly need any special catering or treatment anyways a said like to apologize for acting like judgmental jerk think my initial frustration wa thinking this trip would be different or better than my one and only cruise experience about year ago in some way it wa better in other way it wasn but after day felt like fool for signing up for it once again there were lot of thing that just reaffirmed my feeling and let it overwhelm me thats my problem followed travel advice not to let this bleed into our vacation for the sake of the rest of the family never intended to but your advice just made me more conscious did have discussion about my annoyance regarding the cruise with my gf once she brought up being frustrated herself with the crowd here are my takeaway the positives the destination the bahamian people were lot of fun enjoyed nassau when many people on cruise tripadvisor etc called it the armpit of the caribbean half moon cay wa top beach for me and turks and caicos wa also good time the weather my previous cruise wa pacific mexican cruise which is colder what sold me on caribbean cruise wa the warmer weather and ocean and it did not disappoint the staff can compliment them enough they work really hard to make thing perfect for you we had issue which ll delve into in the negative but dont place any blame on them they deserve better treatment for the work they do the meh the drinks overall pretty good never felt cheated on alcohol and the higher end bar had some fun cocktail my only gripe is the cost at per cocktail entertainment the pool were very small and crowded for ship of this size and quickly turned color which is kind of gross the teen got in the pool think just one time just not fan of the theatre show they had felt like wa just killing time they weren bad but it wa like watching an ok cover band the comedian were pretty good the nightclub wa weird all the chair and table faced the dance floor which think scared everyone from getting out there to dance we danced anyways but there wa never more than people out there we picked this cruise because it wa more friendly to kid and teen and they were all bored by day lol felt like we had more activity previous all inclusives simply because there are le time and weather constraint it wa frustrating when we wanted to dance to latin music the dj wa only slotted for minute there are naturally limitation with cruise ship the negatives the people ll start by saying did meet some genuinely nice people no they were not intrepid world traveler but they were nice did meet some downright trashy and rude people though people berating worker over trivial thing like not enough ice in their water one man wa genuinely upset and said he never go on carnival cruise again because guy fieri burger joint wa only open on sea day lots of politically conservative people which is fine dont care who felt like it wa appropriate to talk politics idk just dont like to talk politics to stranger particularly when travelling even if generally agree with people one couple asked me why haven fled that hell hole live in ll let you guess the state and when told them it wasn a bad a fox news say they had nothing more to talk about also just felt like this wa bad representation of americans there wa very obese man on his knee fanning himself because the nassau pier wa too long of walk it make me sad that this how many caribbean nation see americans the food breakfast wa consistently bad and it wa the same option every day lunch wa better and dinner hit or miss the fun food option like pizza and their poor excuse for mexican food were not good oh and guy fieri burger wa not good either the service like said dont blame the worker can tell they are really trying hard but something wa off it just wasn working maybe there were short staffed idk it took minute to get drink at dinner one of the kid wanted hot chocolate that took minute almost an hour for bagel just lot of random little thing the pollution know know all travelling is bad for the environment can deny it but cruising is double middle finger to planet earth people thought wa exaggerating about the black exhaust smoke but wasn just look at the exhaust stack when we left miami there wa visible haze over the port area these engine run and are le efficient than any other mode of transport cruising is the rolling coal of vacation mode just because other mode of transport are toxic doesn give cruising free pas wont budge from that not an environmentalist by any stretch but it just felt obnoxiously bad maybe someone can explain but why are we not running these thing with nuclear engine overall summary get why some of you guy enjoy it but it not for me feel like all inclusives are better overall but to each their own learned from my trip that it really is what you make of it didnt sulk away in my cabin went out and looked for way to have fun alcohol and socializing helped when we asked the teen how they enjoyed it the result were mixed fortunately for me think they would rather do fixed destination next year most of the negative would have been alleviated with higher end cruise however this trip ended up costing about for the cruise itself roughly in tax fee drink and excursion 2400ish in hotel flight parking etc not bad for group of but from what gather they enjoyed some of our previous vacation more holland america would have been more for the same experience norwegian more and princess would have been more its clear got what paid for but skeptical we would have been happy spending on trip can excuse lot of thing like food or inconvenience when traveling personally enjoy the unpredictability but for this trip we were sold good food good entertainment and good time and the result were mixed in the end the general consensus wa that we all enjoyed our time off the ship more than on the ship
travel,"Guided Tours of Pompeii: should I book in advance or find a guide at the entrance?I will be in Pompeii in June (on a Saturday) and will have about 5 hrs to spend as I will have to catch a train to another city in the afternoon. I want to do a guided tour but can't decide if I should book one through a third party (Walks of Italy offers a good one for $65) which is pricey, or join one of the licensed guides that are by the entrance (but would be much cheaper)? From my research it sounds like they wait for a group of 8-10 people to accrue, and once enough people join they start the tour. I'm not sure if this would be more time-consuming since we have to wait for enough people to join the group, or worse if they will all be booked and I won't be able to find an available guide since I'll be there during the high season. 

So my question is, is it worth booking a third party tour in advance to make sure I get in and leave on time or will I have no trouble getting a guide at the entrance?","['Guided', 'Tours', 'of', 'Pompeii', 'should', 'book', 'in', 'advance', 'or', 'find', 'guide', 'at', 'the', 'entrance', 'will', 'be', 'in', 'Pompeii', 'in', 'June', 'on', 'Saturday', 'and', 'will', 'have', 'about', 'hrs', 'to', 'spend', 'as', 'will', 'have', 'to', 'catch', 'train', 'to', 'another', 'city', 'in', 'the', 'afternoon', 'want', 'to', 'do', 'guided', 'tour', 'but', 'can', 'decide', 'if', 'should', 'book', 'one', 'through', 'third', 'party', 'Walks', 'of', 'Italy', 'offers', 'good', 'one', 'for', 'which', 'is', 'pricey', 'or', 'join', 'one', 'of', 'the', 'licensed', 'guides', 'that', 'are', 'by', 'the', 'entrance', 'but', 'would', 'be', 'much', 'cheaper', 'From', 'my', 'research', 'it', 'sounds', 'like', 'they', 'wait', 'for', 'group', 'of', 'people', 'to', 'accrue', 'and', 'once', 'enough', 'people', 'join', 'they', 'start', 'the', 'tour', 'not', 'sure', 'if', 'this', 'would', 'be', 'more', 'time', 'consuming', 'since', 'we', 'have', 'to', 'wait', 'for', 'enough', 'people', 'to', 'join', 'the', 'group', 'or', 'worse', 'if', 'they', 'will', 'all', 'be', 'booked', 'and', 'won', 'be', 'able', 'to', 'find', 'an', 'available', 'guide', 'since', 'll', 'be', 'there', 'during', 'the', 'high', 'season', 'So', 'my', 'question', 'is', 'is', 'it', 'worth', 'booking', 'third', 'party', 'tour', 'in', 'advance', 'to', 'make', 'sure', 'get', 'in', 'and', 'leave', 'on', 'time', 'or', 'will', 'have', 'no', 'trouble', 'getting', 'guide', 'at', 'the', 'entrance']",guided tours of pompeii should book in advance or find guide at the entrance will be in pompeii in june on saturday and will have about hr to spend a will have to catch train to another city in the afternoon want to do guided tour but can decide if should book one through third party walks of italy offer good one for which is pricey or join one of the licensed guide that are by the entrance but would be much cheaper from my research it sound like they wait for group of people to accrue and once enough people join they start the tour not sure if this would be more time consuming since we have to wait for enough people to join the group or worse if they will all be booked and won be able to find an available guide since ll be there during the high season so my question is is it worth booking third party tour in advance to make sure get in and leave on time or will have no trouble getting guide at the entrance
travel,"Cannot use Nexus Lane if over the Exemption Limit? hey all,  


I have a question regarding the nexus. It would be my initial enrolment. I am in a bordering town and just like many others here, make day road trips to the US for shopping, groceries and gas. Looking at the convenience of shorter wait times in the nexus line, I am intrigued to apply for the program.  


However, I read this on the CBSA website: [https://www.cbsa-asfc.gc.ca/prog/nexus/ ... e-eng.html](https://www.cbsa-asfc.gc.ca/prog/nexus/land-terre-eng.html) 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; if you are a Canadian, U.S. or Mexican resident and you are importing goods for your own personal use, and you are within your personal exemption or entitlement, you may use the NEXUS lane and make an oral declaration to the U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officer. If you are over your personal exemption or entitlement, you must use a regular traffic lane to report your goods. 

 So does it mean that if you are over your exemption limit you cannot use the nexus lane at all? Considering there is no personal exemption for day trips, does that mean coming back to Canada from the US, I would not be able to use the Nexus lane sine I will have groceries and lets say other shopping such as clothes etc.? My understanding was as long as you declare thruthfully you are able to use Nexus.  


Can some current nexus holders please comment? I find it rather strange to believe that all those people I see scooting in the nexus lane have been away for more than 24 hours from Canada.

travel,"Will be in London for 3 months this summer. What to do and what side trips to go on?I am an American, but will be in London for 3 months over the summer for an internship. From what I have been told, the internship is very relaxed, and instead of being required to be somewhere from 8am-5pm, we are just given projects that need to be completed remotely, that should not take anywhere near my full time.

I'm curious if anyone here might have any advice or recommendations on places I should visit in the UK or surrounding countries over my 3 month period abroad? Any of your favorite places that you have visited, places you went that you did not prefer, or just general advice, I would love to hear about.

travel,"Asia summer trip - first timers, any advice?Hello! 

So basically myself and my girlfriend are planning a trip to Asia(first time in this continent), between 7-10 weeks - or more specifically Japan, Vietnam and Indonesia, and was looking for some help with my very first draft itinerary or just general advice. Again this is a first draft so if it’s absolutely ridiculous or not feasible let me know haha! 

So the plan was start in Japan (3 weeks)
Tokyo &gt; Kyoto/Osaka

Then Vietnam (2 weeks)
fly to Hanoi
Hanoi &gt; Halong Bay, fly to Ho Chi Minh City 

Then Indonesia (2 weeks)
Ho Chi Minh City &gt; Denpasar 
Spend time in Ubud/Canggu/Seminyak



This is a very basic first draft based on a little bit of research and what we want to see - we are non drinkers, mid 20s and want to immerse ourselves in the different cultures, scenery and also do a bit of cliche tourist box ticking. 

As I said we can expand to 10 weeks and would love to explore anywhere else, so if there’s any countries or locations that are right beside our path that you think we’d be really missing out let us know! We won’t do the crazy long trains though - so any suggestions by boat or plane would be nice. 

Any general advice would also be much appreciated.","['Asia', 'summer', 'trip', 'first', 'timers', 'any', 'advice', 'Hello', 'So', 'basically', 'myself', 'and', 'my', 'girlfriend', 'are', 'planning', 'trip', 'to', 'Asia', 'first', 'time', 'in', 'this', 'continent', 'between', 'weeks', 'or', 'more', 'specifically', 'Japan', 'Vietnam', 'and', 'Indonesia', 'and', 'was', 'looking', 'for', 'some', 'help', 'with', 'my', 'very', 'first', 'draft', 'itinerary', 'or', 'just', 'general', 'advice', 'Again', 'this', 'is', 'first', 'draft', 'so', 'if', 'it', 'absolutely', 'ridiculous', 'or', 'not', 'feasible', 'let', 'me', 'know', 'haha', 'So', 'the', 'plan', 'was', 'start', 'in', 'Japan', 'weeks', 'Tokyo', 'gt', 'Kyoto', 'Osaka', 'Then', 'Vietnam', 'weeks', 'fly', 'to', 'Hanoi', 'Hanoi', 'gt', 'Halong', 'Bay', 'fly', 'to', 'Ho', 'Chi', 'Minh', 'City', 'Then', 'Indonesia', 'weeks', 'Ho', 'Chi', 'Minh', 'City', 'gt', 'Denpasar', 'Spend', 'time', 'in', 'Ubud', 'Canggu', 'Seminyak', 'This', 'is', 'very', 'basic', 'first', 'draft', 'based', 'on', 'little', 'bit', 'of', 'research', 'and', 'what', 'we', 'want', 'to', 'see', 'we', 'are', 'non', 'drinkers', 'mid', '20s', 'and', 'want', 'to', 'immerse', 'ourselves', 'in', 'the', 'different', 'cultures', 'scenery', 'and', 'also', 'do', 'bit', 'of', 'cliche', 'tourist', 'box', 'ticking', 'As', 'said', 'we', 'can', 'expand', 'to', 'weeks', 'and', 'would', 'love', 'to', 'explore', 'anywhere', 'else', 'so', 'if', 'there', 'any', 'countries', 'or', 'locations', 'that', 'are', 'right', 'beside', 'our', 'path', 'that', 'you', 'think', 'we', 'be', 'really', 'missing', 'out', 'let', 'us', 'know', 'We', 'won', 'do', 'the', 'crazy', 'long', 'trains', 'though', 'so', 'any', 'suggestions', 'by', 'boat', 'or', 'plane', 'would', 'be', 'nice', 'Any', 'general', 'advice', 'would', 'also', 'be', 'much', 'appreciated']",asia summer trip first timer any advice hello so basically myself and my girlfriend are planning trip to asia first time in this continent between week or more specifically japan vietnam and indonesia and wa looking for some help with my very first draft itinerary or just general advice again this is first draft so if it absolutely ridiculous or not feasible let me know haha so the plan wa start in japan week tokyo gt kyoto osaka then vietnam week fly to hanoi hanoi gt halong bay fly to ho chi minh city then indonesia week ho chi minh city gt denpasar spend time in ubud canggu seminyak this is very basic first draft based on little bit of research and what we want to see we are non drinker mid 20 and want to immerse ourselves in the different culture scenery and also do bit of cliche tourist box ticking as said we can expand to week and would love to explore anywhere else so if there any country or location that are right beside our path that you think we be really missing out let u know we won do the crazy long train though so any suggestion by boat or plane would be nice any general advice would also be much appreciated

travel,"Advice on choosing a destination to party and relax before graduating! (Preferably in Mexico)My friend group, all 20-21 year old males, is planning to go on a trip in early November before some of us go on to graduate. 

\-We're flying out from Alberta, Canada and would like the trip to be 5-7 days long. 

\-For budget, we're comfortable spending $1500 CAD (about $1200 USD) but if it's worth it, willing to go up to $2000 CAD (about $1600 USD)

As for what we're looking for:

\-Similar age group, some of our guys are lonely and would like to meet some people haha

\-All-Inclusive; I know AI gets a lot of hate but we've done other trips in the past where we went out and had every day planned, but for this trip, we want to relax, sit back, and be lazy. Plus we're a drinking group, so AI definitely helps with that.

\-Even though I just said we'd like to be lazy, we also want a decent selection of excursions on days we feel like going out. Things like ziplining, ATV tours, and little hikes are all things we would love to do.

\-Decent nightlife and good food

Some places we're considering: Cabo, Puerto Vallarta, Playa del Carmen, Costa Rica, Puerto Rico, and Aruba. Do tell of any experiences you've had in these places, good or bad, and let me know any other places we should consider!

travel,"Solo travel to Greek Islands OR Contiki (25f)Hi there,

I am a 25F South Asian American. I haven't done much solo traveling or traveling because of the last two years in the pandemic, but want to get back into it this summer. I would love to visit Greece mainland and the islands, however, my friends can't join me this time. Thus, I have to travel solo.

I looked into Contiki's island hopping tour that goes (Athens --&gt; Santorini --&gt; Mykonos) for the social aspect of the trip. As a brown female, it would be nice to have a solid group to go out with and form friendships with. I've noticed that majority of these trips are more for folks in their early 20s and also not very diverse. This matters to me as a minority. 

I am also wondering if I can get the same experience through hostels. Will there be hostels that facilitate the social aspect or would it be less likely? The cost will be less and I'll also have more flexibility with flights/length/day.

I have about two days to decide before I have to pay up, so any help appreciated.","['Solo', 'travel', 'to', 'Greek', 'Islands', 'OR', 'Contiki', '25f', 'Hi', 'there', 'am', '25F', 'South', 'Asian', 'American', 'haven', 'done', 'much', 'solo', 'traveling', 'or', 'traveling', 'because', 'of', 'the', 'last', 'two', 'years', 'in', 'the', 'pandemic', 'but', 'want', 'to', 'get', 'back', 'into', 'it', 'this', 'summer', 'would', 'love', 'to', 'visit', 'Greece', 'mainland', 'and', 'the', 'islands', 'however', 'my', 'friends', 'can', 'join', 'me', 'this', 'time', 'Thus', 'have', 'to', 'travel', 'solo', 'looked', 'into', 'Contiki', 'island', 'hopping', 'tour', 'that', 'goes', 'Athens', 'gt', 'Santorini', 'gt', 'Mykonos', 'for', 'the', 'social', 'aspect', 'of', 'the', 'trip', 'As', 'brown', 'female', 'it', 'would', 'be', 'nice', 'to', 'have', 'solid', 'group', 'to', 'go', 'out', 'with', 'and', 'form', 'friendships', 'with', 've', 'noticed', 'that', 'majority', 'of', 'these', 'trips', 'are', 'more', 'for', 'folks', 'in', 'their', 'early', '20s', 'and', 'also', 'not', 'very', 'diverse', 'This', 'matters', 'to', 'me', 'as', 'minority', 'am', 'also', 'wondering', 'if', 'can', 'get', 'the', 'same', 'experience', 'through', 'hostels', 'Will', 'there', 'be', 'hostels', 'that', 'facilitate', 'the', 'social', 'aspect', 'or', 'would', 'it', 'be', 'less', 'likely', 'The', 'cost', 'will', 'be', 'less', 'and', 'll', 'also', 'have', 'more', 'flexibility', 'with', 'flights', 'length', 'day', 'have', 'about', 'two', 'days', 'to', 'decide', 'before', 'have', 'to', 'pay', 'up', 'so', 'any', 'help', 'appreciated']",solo travel to greek islands or contiki 25f hi there am 25f south asian american haven done much solo traveling or traveling because of the last two year in the pandemic but want to get back into it this summer would love to visit greece mainland and the island however my friend can join me this time thus have to travel solo looked into contiki island hopping tour that go athens gt santorini gt mykonos for the social aspect of the trip as brown female it would be nice to have solid group to go out with and form friendship with ve noticed that majority of these trip are more for folk in their early 20 and also not very diverse this matter to me a minority am also wondering if can get the same experience through hostel will there be hostel that facilitate the social aspect or would it be le likely the cost will be le and ll also have more flexibility with flight length day have about two day to decide before have to pay up so any help appreciated

thanks!","['schengen', 'visa', 'questionhello', 'will', 'be', 'spending', 'my', 'full', 'days', 'in', 'the', 'schengen', 'area', 'flying', 'out', 'of', 'munich', 'to', 'london', 'on', 'my', '90th', 'day', 'am', 'planning', 'on', 'flying', 'home', 'to', 'the', 'US', 'out', 'of', 'london', 'alas', 'the', 'majority', 'of', 'flights', 'looking', 'at', 'have', 'layover', 'in', 'lisbon', 'the', 'one', 'hoping', 'to', 'get', 'on', 'is', 'connecting', 'flight', 'with', 'hour', 'layover', 'in', 'lisbon', 'so', 'it', 'not', 'self', 'transfer', 'would', 'it', 'be', 'okay', 'to', 'take', 'flight', 'from', 'london', 'that', 'connects', 'through', 'lisbon', 'like', 'can', 'stay', 'in', 'the', 'connection', 'area', 'only', 'would', 'have', 'to', 'go', 'through', 'schengen', 'customs', 'again', 'and', 'probably', 'be', 'turned', 'away', 'if', 'the', 'final', 'destination', 'from', 'london', 'is', 'the', 'US', 'anyway', 'thanks']",schengen visa questionhello will be spending my full day in the schengen area flying out of munich to london on my 90th day am planning on flying home to the us out of london ala the majority of flight looking at have layover in lisbon the one hoping to get on is connecting flight with hour layover in lisbon so it not self transfer would it be okay to take flight from london that connects through lisbon like can stay in the connection area only would have to go through schengen custom again and probably be turned away if the final destination from london is the us anyway thanks
travel,"Tipping culture in America, gone wild?We just returned from the US and I felt obliged to tip nearly everyone for everything! Restaurants, ok I get it.. the going rate now is 18% minimum so it’s not small change. We were paying $30 minimum on top of each meal. 

It was asking if we wanted to tip at places where we queued up and bought food from the till, the card machine asked if we wanted to tip 18%, 20% or 25%. 

This is what I don’t understand, I’ve queued up, placed my order, paid for a service which you will kindly provide.. ie food and I need to tip YOU for it? 

Then there’s cabs, hotel staff, bar staff, even at breakfast which was included they asked us to sign a blank $0 bill just so we had the option to tip the staff. So wait another $15 per day?

travel,"June trip to Italy - 1 weekHi all,

Me and my other half are going for a trip to Italy in June. We are not much of the adventurers, just looking forward to see Rome and spend some quality time in some other city.

We are flying to Rome, then we would like to go for the calm nice city with beach or something similar, and have some rest. Then we are going to get back to Rome 2 days before flying back to our country, just to do some sighstseeing.

Can someone recommend the city we should go for in between the Roma (5 days/4 nights)?

Also, can anyone recommend best way to reach that city and perhaps how should we move (train, taxi?) between the airport (Ciampino) and Rome?

Ideally don't want to do ***loads*** of driving (2 days-ish coastal road tripping including stops), but a scenic drive would be great. Probably aiming to spend 2/3 days in SF before we head south.

Thanks in advance :)","['SF', 'to', 'LA', 'best', 'way', 'to', 'mix', 'both', 'Amtrak', 'amp', 'driving', 'highway', 'Couple', 'of', 'Brits', 'landing', 'in', 'San', 'Francisco', 'in', 'mid', 'August', 'making', 'our', 'way', 'down', 'to', 'LA', 'over', 'the', 'course', 'of', 'week', 'We', 'took', 'an', 'overnight', 'Amtrak', 'from', 'Portland', 'down', 'to', 'SF', 'last', 'time', 'we', 'visited', 'and', 'loved', 'it', 'so', 'would', 'like', 'to', 'do', 'mix', 'of', 'Amtrak', 'amp', 'driving', 'highway', 'but', 'trying', 'to', 'work', 'out', 'the', 'best', 'way', 'to', 'do', 'it', 'while', 'maximizing', 'sightseeing', 'etc', 'Heard', 'good', 'things', 'about', 'Carmel', 'Santa', 'Cruz', 'Big', 'Sur', 'etc', 'Ideally', 'don', 'want', 'to', 'do', 'loads', 'of', 'driving', 'days', 'ish', 'coastal', 'road', 'tripping', 'including', 'stops', 'but', 'scenic', 'drive', 'would', 'be', 'great', 'Probably', 'aiming', 'to', 'spend', 'days', 'in', 'SF', 'before', 'we', 'head', 'south', 'Thanks', 'in', 'advance']",sf to la best way to mix both amtrak amp driving highway couple of brits landing in san francisco in mid august making our way down to la over the course of week we took an overnight amtrak from portland down to sf last time we visited and loved it so would like to do mix of amtrak amp driving highway but trying to work out the best way to do it while maximizing sightseeing etc heard good thing about carmel santa cruz big sur etc ideally don want to do load of driving day ish coastal road tripping including stop but scenic drive would be great probably aiming to spend day in sf before we head south thanks in advance

travel,"Advice on quiet, non-touristy and small beach town in Europe or African west coastI have a very specific wish. To spend a few weeks in a small and quiet beach town within walking distance of a quiet and peaceful and warm and sunny beach. I'm thinking of the Mediterranean, Madeira or the Canary islands, but it has to be very non-touristy. I want my peace and quiet.

In any case: I won't go in the tourist high season.

So the requirements listed:

* Small and quiet town. I only need 1 shop for groceries
* Apartment within walking distance of the beach
* Balcony/terrace with the apartment with privacy!
* Warm and sunny, at least 25 degrees
* Quiet beach, few people
* Clothing optional on the beach would be a great bonus, but not required as this would severely limit my options I think

travel,"Site/App to share your destination and make friendsHello guys, how are you?? New here. I’ve traveled a few times in my life but those experiences has been some of my beautiful memories. So, what I would like to ask you it’s an question I’ve think about in these days. How do you see a site/app where you can create your own profile with details like name surname ecc… and you can see other people registered too and see where they go and share the destination. For example if you are going to Australia, there are other people who are going too and you can ask them if they are been there for the first time or if you want to see there or eventually if you start talking with them why they are going too in that place maybe for work or something. There is maybe a functionality where you can add a countdown like instagram for event but in this site you can put a countdown for your departure with an interface that show at other your path like -10, -9 and something like that. Sorry for my English I’m from Italy but let me know what you think about that. Especially for who travel alone, do you eventually use if this exist? Do you think is useless?

travel,"Help with the VeriFLY app not accepting my flight number?Have a connecting flight booked from Dublin to Boston on April 27th from Aer Lingus, they keep giving me emails advising me to use the VeriFLY app so I can get checked into my flight faster.

I've heard from a lot of people that doing this makes things a lot quicker and easier so I'd love to actually get it filled in even though I know it's optional. Problem is, the VeriFLY app asks you for your flight number, but when I try to type it down it shows a dropdown menu which shows 2 already existing flight numbers.

I thought maybe just putting down my actual flight number would work anyways but when I did this and tried to continue to the next step, it showed an error under the flight number section with text under it saying ""Please select a flight number.""

Could use some help, I don't travel often (in fact this is my second time ever boarding a plane by myself) and I'm even less familiar with this app, I'm not sure if I'm making some sort of simple mistake or if it's really just a problem with the app itself?

travel,"Can you travel in the EU with a non-EU passport that is expiring within 5 months?Hi! This is sort of a last-minute cry for help as I’ve booked and fully planned a trip to Austria in a few days before realising that my passport is expiring in 5 months. Big yikes

For context my passport is of a non-EU country for which no visa is required for travelling to most EU countries as long as my stay does not exceed 3 months. Fyi I have residential permit in the UK as I’m on the student visa and I will be travelling to any other European country from the UK.

I checked some websites and according to some, it’s unlikely I can enter an EU country with a non-EU passport expiring within 5 months. Yet some say it’s fine as long as the passport doesn’t expire within 3 months. So I’m now in semi confusion and semi panic that all my travel plan is gonna fall through. Does anyone have some ideas or happen to know someone who had similar experiences?

travel,"Checking into 2 conflicting flights?My family is going on vacation in a couple of days.  I booked all of our flights well ahead of time and since then some people’s plans have changed and they had to book another flight that leaves a little later.

The flight we all have booked is with Scandinavian Air and they won’t give us a refund if we cancel their reservations.  The new flight they booked is with Lufthansa (it’s a flight from the US to Germany if that matters).

Scandinavian air lets you check in 30 hours early and pick your seats for free. Because we can’t get a refund, we were hoping to just check in the people who aren’t coming so we can reserve their seat next to ours so we could at least get some extra room.

My question is, would that cause any issues for them to check into their other flights that leave a couple hours later with Lufthansa? And is there any other issues with us doing that?","['Checking', 'into', 'conflicting', 'flights', 'My', 'family', 'is', 'going', 'on', 'vacation', 'in', 'couple', 'of', 'days', 'booked', 'all', 'of', 'our', 'flights', 'well', 'ahead', 'of', 'time', 'and', 'since', 'then', 'some', 'people', 'plans', 'have', 'changed', 'and', 'they', 'had', 'to', 'book', 'another', 'flight', 'that', 'leaves', 'little', 'later', 'The', 'flight', 'we', 'all', 'have', 'booked', 'is', 'with', 'Scandinavian', 'Air', 'and', 'they', 'won', 'give', 'us', 'refund', 'if', 'we', 'cancel', 'their', 'reservations', 'The', 'new', 'flight', 'they', 'booked', 'is', 'with', 'Lufthansa', 'it', 'flight', 'from', 'the', 'US', 'to', 'Germany', 'if', 'that', 'matters', 'Scandinavian', 'air', 'lets', 'you', 'check', 'in', 'hours', 'early', 'and', 'pick', 'your', 'seats', 'for', 'free', 'Because', 'we', 'can', 'get', 'refund', 'we', 'were', 'hoping', 'to', 'just', 'check', 'in', 'the', 'people', 'who', 'aren', 'coming', 'so', 'we', 'can', 'reserve', 'their', 'seat', 'next', 'to', 'ours', 'so', 'we', 'could', 'at', 'least', 'get', 'some', 'extra', 'room', 'My', 'question', 'is', 'would', 'that', 'cause', 'any', 'issues', 'for', 'them', 'to', 'check', 'into', 'their', 'other', 'flights', 'that', 'leave', 'couple', 'hours', 'later', 'with', 'Lufthansa', 'And', 'is', 'there', 'any', 'other', 'issues', 'with', 'us', 'doing', 'that']",checking into conflicting flight my family is going on vacation in couple of day booked all of our flight well ahead of time and since then some people plan have changed and they had to book another flight that leaf little later the flight we all have booked is with scandinavian air and they won give u refund if we cancel their reservation the new flight they booked is with lufthansa it flight from the us to germany if that matter scandinavian air let you check in hour early and pick your seat for free because we can get refund we were hoping to just check in the people who aren coming so we can reserve their seat next to ours so we could at least get some extra room my question is would that cause any issue for them to check into their other flight that leave couple hour later with lufthansa and is there any other issue with u doing that

travel,"Cartagena, Colombia vs Bali Indonesia for (beginner) solo traveller
Hi! I (25F) will be taking a one week trip to either of these destinations. This is my first international solo trip. [travelled within the US and in the Caribbean where I lived before]. My main goal for the trip is to get out of the USA, meet new people, experience a culture outside of my own and rest by meditating and reflecting.

Being more specific, I hope to experience:
- Nature and beautiful landscapes (forest, hills, rivers, beaches)
- Interesting architecture (one of the reasons Bali is appealing is the temples, they seem almost magical)
- A culturally immersive experience where I can meet new people, go to local events and experience their ways of life
- The opportunity to meditate and rest deeply (Bali seems more oriented towards this)
- A comfortable Airbnb with a view, possibly a pool, not interested in a hostel.
- parties, where I can dance to music (any style but especially salsa, bachata, reggaeton etc)

My main hesitations for Colombia are that I know it has not always been the safest place, and I’m not sure about how easy transportation will be.

My hesitations with Bali 
- how far away it is for my first international solo trip
- not sure where I will meet new people
- Transportation and cell service might be hard to get?

I would love to hear from those who’ve been to either, what you liked about either place. Any issues that came up with safety? Which would you recommend for a rookie solo traveller? 
Also if you have other destinations that you think would be great for getting into solo international travel, feel free to share.","['Cartagena', 'Colombia', 'vs', 'Bali', 'Indonesia', 'for', 'beginner', 'solo', 'traveller', 'Hi', '25F', 'will', 'be', 'taking', 'one', 'week', 'trip', 'to', 'either', 'of', 'these', 'destinations', 'This', 'is', 'my', 'first', 'international', 'solo', 'trip', 'travelled', 'within', 'the', 'US', 'and', 'in', 'the', 'Caribbean', 'where', 'lived', 'before', 'My', 'main', 'goal', 'for', 'the', 'trip', 'is', 'to', 'get', 'out', 'of', 'the', 'USA', 'meet', 'new', 'people', 'experience', 'culture', 'outside', 'of', 'my', 'own', 'and', 'rest', 'by', 'meditating', 'and', 'reflecting', 'Being', 'more', 'specific', 'hope', 'to', 'experience', 'Nature', 'and', 'beautiful', 'landscapes', 'forest', 'hills', 'rivers', 'beaches', 'Interesting', 'architecture', 'one', 'of', 'the', 'reasons', 'Bali', 'is', 'appealing', 'is', 'the', 'temples', 'they', 'seem', 'almost', 'magical', 'culturally', 'immersive', 'experience', 'where', 'can', 'meet', 'new', 'people', 'go', 'to', 'local', 'events', 'and', 'experience', 'their', 'ways', 'of', 'life', 'The', 'opportunity', 'to', 'meditate', 'and', 'rest', 'deeply', 'Bali', 'seems', 'more', 'oriented', 'towards', 'this', 'comfortable', 'Airbnb', 'with', 'view', 'possibly', 'pool', 'not', 'interested', 'in', 'hostel', 'parties', 'where', 'can', 'dance', 'to', 'music', 'any', 'style', 'but', 'especially', 'salsa', 'bachata', 'reggaeton', 'etc', 'My', 'main', 'hesitations', 'for', 'Colombia', 'are', 'that', 'know', 'it', 'has', 'not', 'always', 'been', 'the', 'safest', 'place', 'and', 'not', 'sure', 'about', 'how', 'easy', 'transportation', 'will', 'be', 'My', 'hesitations', 'with', 'Bali', 'how', 'far', 'away', 'it', 'is', 'for', 'my', 'first', 'international', 'solo', 'trip', 'not', 'sure', 'where', 'will', 'meet', 'new', 'people', 'Transportation', 'and', 'cell', 'service', 'might', 'be', 'hard', 'to', 'get', 'would', 'love', 'to', 'hear', 'from', 'those', 'who', 've', 'been', 'to', 'either', 'what', 'you', 'liked', 'about', 'either', 'place', 'Any', 'issues', 'that', 'came', 'up', 'with', 'safety', 'Which', 'would', 'you', 'recommend', 'for', 'rookie', 'solo', 'traveller', 'Also', 'if', 'you', 'have', 'other', 'destinations', 'that', 'you', 'think', 'would', 'be', 'great', 'for', 'getting', 'into', 'solo', 'international', 'travel', 'feel', 'free', 'to', 'share']",cartagena colombia v bali indonesia for beginner solo traveller hi 25f will be taking one week trip to either of these destination this is my first international solo trip travelled within the us and in the caribbean where lived before my main goal for the trip is to get out of the usa meet new people experience culture outside of my own and rest by meditating and reflecting being more specific hope to experience nature and beautiful landscape forest hill river beach interesting architecture one of the reason bali is appealing is the temple they seem almost magical culturally immersive experience where can meet new people go to local event and experience their way of life the opportunity to meditate and rest deeply bali seems more oriented towards this comfortable airbnb with view possibly pool not interested in hostel party where can dance to music any style but especially salsa bachata reggaeton etc my main hesitation for colombia are that know it ha not always been the safest place and not sure about how easy transportation will be my hesitation with bali how far away it is for my first international solo trip not sure where will meet new people transportation and cell service might be hard to get would love to hear from those who ve been to either what you liked about either place any issue that came up with safety which would you recommend for rookie solo traveller also if you have other destination that you think would be great for getting into solo international travel feel free to share

travel,"Most comfortable walking shoes - not Sneakers I'm retired and getting ready to travel for the first time since the pandemic. I will be walking many miles during this vacation, and I seek a comfortable shoe that provides support and style, with a heavy emphasis on ***comfort***.

My size is 11.5 wide, and I've looked online but the only thing that comes up when I search for walking shoes is actually running shoes, or sneakers. I don't want a sneaker look, I'd prefer something more shoe-like, but clearly casual. But the overriding aspect has to be comfort. I don't want to have to break in with blisters or walk around on Frankenstein boots, I want to walk on a tall, orthopedic cloud, if that's possible.

Cost is always an issue, of course, but I'm spending a small fortune on this trip and this purchase is intended to be the difference between a good vacation and a miserable one, so I'm happy to pay well for the right shoe.

Naturally, reddit is the place to come for some objective advice. I'd appreciate any recommendation.

travel,"HELP: Hotel in Ireland is overbooked for one specific night and the trip starts in a few days.Basically as the title says. Booked a week long vacation in Ireland that starts Wednesday with two rooms well in advance for 800 euros for both rooms for the week, great rate.

Didn't have a problem with this until it became apparent that to get another room pretty much anywhere its going to be 200+ Euros per room for Saturday night.

travel,"Are there any countries you won’t visit because you feel an ethical dilemma about them?With everything going on in the world I was thinking about this last night and curious of others opinions. I’ve been to over ten countries and love traveling and I visited Hong Kong in 2016 right before everything started with China and HK. I’d love to visit China at some point but now it kinda feels morally wrong given what’s happened with HK and the Uyghurs. 

Another example would be Russia. Would love to go there but we all know what’s happening now but hopefully when the war ends it would be great to travel there since their economy is trash and money would go far. 

I think it was a Reddit post I saw where some guy went to Lebanon right after the war ended and said something along the lines of   “Best time to travel is right after a catastrophic event, the security was on high alert, everything was inexpensive and there were no other tourist”. I’m not saying I agree with that for the record but what are your thoughts?","['Are', 'there', 'any', 'countries', 'you', 'won', 'visit', 'because', 'you', 'feel', 'an', 'ethical', 'dilemma', 'about', 'them', 'With', 'everything', 'going', 'on', 'in', 'the', 'world', 'was', 'thinking', 'about', 'this', 'last', 'night', 'and', 'curious', 'of', 'others', 'opinions', 've', 'been', 'to', 'over', 'ten', 'countries', 'and', 'love', 'traveling', 'and', 'visited', 'Hong', 'Kong', 'in', 'right', 'before', 'everything', 'started', 'with', 'China', 'and', 'HK', 'love', 'to', 'visit', 'China', 'at', 'some', 'point', 'but', 'now', 'it', 'kinda', 'feels', 'morally', 'wrong', 'given', 'what', 'happened', 'with', 'HK', 'and', 'the', 'Uyghurs', 'Another', 'example', 'would', 'be', 'Russia', 'Would', 'love', 'to', 'go', 'there', 'but', 'we', 'all', 'know', 'what', 'happening', 'now', 'but', 'hopefully', 'when', 'the', 'war', 'ends', 'it', 'would', 'be', 'great', 'to', 'travel', 'there', 'since', 'their', 'economy', 'is', 'trash', 'and', 'money', 'would', 'go', 'far', 'think', 'it', 'was', 'Reddit', 'post', 'saw', 'where', 'some', 'guy', 'went', 'to', 'Lebanon', 'right', 'after', 'the', 'war', 'ended', 'and', 'said', 'something', 'along', 'the', 'lines', 'of', 'Best', 'time', 'to', 'travel', 'is', 'right', 'after', 'catastrophic', 'event', 'the', 'security', 'was', 'on', 'high', 'alert', 'everything', 'was', 'inexpensive', 'and', 'there', 'were', 'no', 'other', 'tourist', 'not', 'saying', 'agree', 'with', 'that', 'for', 'the', 'record', 'but', 'what', 'are', 'your', 'thoughts']",are there any country you won visit because you feel an ethical dilemma about them with everything going on in the world wa thinking about this last night and curious of others opinion ve been to over ten country and love traveling and visited hong kong in right before everything started with china and hk love to visit china at some point but now it kinda feel morally wrong given what happened with hk and the uyghurs another example would be russia would love to go there but we all know what happening now but hopefully when the war end it would be great to travel there since their economy is trash and money would go far think it wa reddit post saw where some guy went to lebanon right after the war ended and said something along the line of best time to travel is right after catastrophic event the security wa on high alert everything wa inexpensive and there were no other tourist not saying agree with that for the record but what are your thought

travel,"Volunteer work pacific regionHi everyone,

I am 19 and on my gap year. So far I have managed to backpack through south east Asia yet I still have a big wish I want to fulfil. 

I would love to be able to provide volunteer work on a pacific island (Micronesia/Guam/Palau maybe Polynesia if there are good possibilities there although it's a little harder to get to).

Up until now I have found very little interesting/feasible options on the internet. 
Does anyone have experience with this or knows any organisations or websites that could help me?

I would be very interested in volunteering at schools, animal shelters, nature reserves or wildlife shelters. I'm afraid I won't be able to offer a lot as I don't have experience in any of these fields but there have to be at least a few opportunities for someone like me right?

Ideally (although not a requirement) volunteer work with accommodation provided would be very convenient.

travel,"Looking to do a solo trip(21 year old American) 

I’m looking to do an international solo trip sometime in the fall, I’ve been out of the country on many occasions, but never on a solo trip. Also a side note that my air fair is being gifted, so flight price isn’t a concern. 

My goal is to fly into a big city and be able to rent a car, which at 21 will be a challenge in itself. I know that its more efficient to travel by train in most non American countries, however I love driving and I want to see rural areas and be able to stop and experience whatever sites I encounter along the way. My style of traveling is to spend maybe a half day looking at tourist sites, if that, and then spend the rest in the rural areas and getting to know the real culture. 

So far I’ve considered Scotland, Poland and Australia, as well as Kazakhstan.

travel,"MEM Airport car lot kiosk didn’t print ticket; worried my car will be towedArrived earlier today at the Memphis Airport. Dropped off my car in the long-term lot.

When I checked it in, the kiosk said, “please take your ticket”, but it didn’t print a ticket. I didn’t notice anyone around that I could ask for help, I had already paid, and a car had pulled up behind me, so I just drove past the gate.

Once in the lot, I noticed some other vehicles in the lot had a ticket visible on their dash.

travel,"Travel from Sacramento to Los Angeles!Heya! I'm planning a road trip from Sac to Inglewood, LA in July with my boyfriend. I have never driven this far before but I have made the trip once as a preteen. I have driven to Fort Bragg, Montery and Oakland. So i have some questions! We are going to see Wiz Khalifa and Logic concert and most likely staying at the Hotel Indigo :) 

Are we able to rent a car, say from Enterprise, to drive to LA and back? I have a 2020 Honda Civic, with not even 13k miles, so I know it can easily handle the trip, but I'm worried about crime or having it broken into (tinted windows, New parts). Call me paranoid, but I'd rather stay safe. 

(I know flying is cheaper/more efficient BTW, but I like to drive and want to have a more leisurely trip without the hustle of getting to the airport and stuff.)

What sights should we see? I'm planning on taking the highway. Any spots we should stop to see on the way? Once we are there we are going to check the Walk of Fame, Trejos Tacos, maybe a beach or two, and Griffith Observatory. Any other places you would recommend? Neither of us are big on night life, so no need to worry about clubs or bars. Looking more for museums or niche spots. Sadly the Museum of Death is moving locations, so it's temporarily closed :(. 

Is there anything we should look out for or avoid? We are laid back, don't draw much attention to ourselves in general, only let loose when we are in private. No flashy dress or jewelry.

travel,"Opportunity to travel the world, recommendations to go?So my background is I'm a domestic US based airline pilot starting at a new airline. Training is still backlogged so I'm looking at about a ~3 month wait to get into the training classes and simulators due to influx of new hires and recurrent training. 

During this period I am getting paid (training pay = just shy of $4k USD / month) and I also have flight benefits for severely reduced fares for domestic and international travel. 

When i was a kid i only got to vacation within the states, mostly Midwest/east coast, only one trip west and it wasn't much.

During my career I will likely not have another period like this where I have  so much off time and pay, so I need to take advantage as much as possible.

travel,"Hotel bathroom is not cleaned, moved to another room that’s also not cleaned, what should I do? (Hilton, USA)Just checked into a Hilton within the US and was met with hair all over the bathroom - under the vanity, on the bath towels and in the bath tub. I texted the hotel through the Hilton Honors app and they moved us to the room next door. Walk in the bathroom next door and there’s a hair under the vanity (disgusting but fine), and then as I walked deeper in there were several hairs on the side of the toilet. I get queasy very easily, and it is still a pandemic - if they left hairs all over the bathroom how do I know they thoroughly cleaned anything thoroughly? I wouldn’t have been as annoyed about the hairs in the second room if the first room wasn’t horrible everywhere’s I looked, but especially the two together is repulsive. My family member staying with me doesn’t feel like moving rooms again as we have a lot of stuff. 

What is my best course of action? Should I message them now and let them know about the problem with this room or should I tell them at checkout? Does this constitute any compensation?

travel,"Traveling as a solo black dudeI've been planning some major traveling but I keep being told ""You better watch where you are going in XYZ location, you'll have a target on your back"" which prompts a semi ugly discussion about racism and what not.

I plan to stick to the major locations and other than being a pretty laid back America that happens to be black, am I actually at any serious risk more than being in my own backyard? I hate to even think or potentially kill off a certain leg because of it but being solo likely will raise its own eyebrows, maybe?

travel,"How would you compare the capital cities of the Nordic countries? Are they all worth visiting or are some not worth it?Hi, I’m considering making a summer trip around northern Europe (potentially the Nordic countries and/or the Baltic countries). 

Specifically in this post I’m interested in asking about the capital cities of the Nordic capitals (Oslo, Stockholm, Copenhagen, Helsinki, Reykjavik). I don’t think it will be manageable (and financially possible) for me to visit all of these cities in one big northern Europe itinerary, so to help me decide which of these cities to prioritise I’m wondering how you would answer the following questions (or you’re welcome to comment your own experiences of each city - thank you!) -

1) Which Nordic capital is the prettiest and the most geographically and/or architecturally interesting?

2) Which Nordic capital has the most things to do such as interesting museums / historical points of interest 

3) Which Nordic capital has nicest/most interesting food, restaurants amd  cuisine?

4) Which Nordic capital has the most fun nightlife for fun bars, clubs and partying atmosphere amongst locals and tourists?

5) Which Nordic capital is best for local day trips to nice nearby towns/beautiful geographic areas?

travel,"short coach travel storyYesterday evening, my friend and his wife travelled by coach from Heathrow to Bournemouth. The coach was full, so they couldn't sit together, and say with strangers.

My friend tells me he sat with a young, petite blonde girl, who had to grab her bag and stuff for him to sit down. He thanked her, sat, put his headphones on and with the aid of his favourite music, promptly ignored her for ninety minutes.

When the coach got to her stop, he realised she was preparing to leave and moved out the way, just common courtesy. She gets up, turns to him, and completely out-of-the-blue, says in a most earnest manner:

""Thank you. Have a good onward journey.""

He was really quite surprised, and wished her something similar, though he can't remember quite what he said.

He said it was quite unexpected, but completely made his day. However, he has no idea why she thanked him.

If anyone could help suggest a reason, that world be great.","['short', 'coach', 'travel', 'storyYesterday', 'evening', 'my', 'friend', 'and', 'his', 'wife', 'travelled', 'by', 'coach', 'from', 'Heathrow', 'to', 'Bournemouth', 'The', 'coach', 'was', 'full', 'so', 'they', 'couldn', 'sit', 'together', 'and', 'say', 'with', 'strangers', 'My', 'friend', 'tells', 'me', 'he', 'sat', 'with', 'young', 'petite', 'blonde', 'girl', 'who', 'had', 'to', 'grab', 'her', 'bag', 'and', 'stuff', 'for', 'him', 'to', 'sit', 'down', 'He', 'thanked', 'her', 'sat', 'put', 'his', 'headphones', 'on', 'and', 'with', 'the', 'aid', 'of', 'his', 'favourite', 'music', 'promptly', 'ignored', 'her', 'for', 'ninety', 'minutes', 'When', 'the', 'coach', 'got', 'to', 'her', 'stop', 'he', 'realised', 'she', 'was', 'preparing', 'to', 'leave', 'and', 'moved', 'out', 'the', 'way', 'just', 'common', 'courtesy', 'She', 'gets', 'up', 'turns', 'to', 'him', 'and', 'completely', 'out', 'of', 'the', 'blue', 'says', 'in', 'most', 'earnest', 'manner', 'Thank', 'you', 'Have', 'good', 'onward', 'journey', 'He', 'was', 'really', 'quite', 'surprised', 'and', 'wished', 'her', 'something', 'similar', 'though', 'he', 'can', 'remember', 'quite', 'what', 'he', 'said', 'He', 'said', 'it', 'was', 'quite', 'unexpected', 'but', 'completely', 'made', 'his', 'day', 'However', 'he', 'has', 'no', 'idea', 'why', 'she', 'thanked', 'him', 'If', 'anyone', 'could', 'help', 'suggest', 'reason', 'that', 'world', 'be', 'great']",short coach travel storyyesterday evening my friend and his wife travelled by coach from heathrow to bournemouth the coach wa full so they couldn sit together and say with stranger my friend tell me he sat with young petite blonde girl who had to grab her bag and stuff for him to sit down he thanked her sat put his headphone on and with the aid of his favourite music promptly ignored her for ninety minute when the coach got to her stop he realised she wa preparing to leave and moved out the way just common courtesy she get up turn to him and completely out of the blue say in most earnest manner thank you have good onward journey he wa really quite surprised and wished her something similar though he can remember quite what he said he said it wa quite unexpected but completely made his day however he ha no idea why she thanked him if anyone could help suggest reason that world be great

travel,"Advice for First International Trip to South AmericaAs title says, I am looking for advice on me and my partners first out of country trip. We live in Houston, but have travelled a good bit across the US. It looks like we’re going to come into some money later this year, and we wanted to do a long trip starting in Quito, Ecuador and travel down thrown Peru, Bolivia, and presumably end in Argentina. 

I’ve done a lot of research on the countries themselves and know what to expect, at least as much as I can from the internet alone. My problem arose when I realized there are no barges that regularly carry passenger vehicles into Panama and then out the other side into Pacific South America. Without a vehicle, I’m not sure how we could travel that long distance, but specially considering we had wanted to see all we could along the way. I came to two conclusions:

1. We bite the bullet and fly town to town. It would be so expensive it makes me sweat, and we’d miss a lot of what we want to see along the way, but it hard to imagine option 2.

2. We just drive south to Panama and cross the Darien strait via barge. The issue here is that we have a soft top jeep and I’m not sure that’s be the best option given the ease it could be broken into. Additionally, I have read that some of the countries along the way have nosy police who would be happy to stop a gringo like myself for a bribe to keep going.

Which of these is advisable given my situation? Are there actually vehicle barges I don’t know about that go to Panama and beyond? Is there a better way to travel across land than by car?
Is there some third option I’m missing? Thanks in advance!

For additional context, we want to see everything these countries have to offer because we plan on moving to one of them in the future and want to see them in their entirety (at least as much as you can in one trip).","['Advice', 'for', 'First', 'International', 'Trip', 'to', 'South', 'AmericaAs', 'title', 'says', 'am', 'looking', 'for', 'advice', 'on', 'me', 'and', 'my', 'partners', 'first', 'out', 'of', 'country', 'trip', 'We', 'live', 'in', 'Houston', 'but', 'have', 'travelled', 'good', 'bit', 'across', 'the', 'US', 'It', 'looks', 'like', 'we', 're', 'going', 'to', 'come', 'into', 'some', 'money', 'later', 'this', 'year', 'and', 'we', 'wanted', 'to', 'do', 'long', 'trip', 'starting', 'in', 'Quito', 'Ecuador', 'and', 'travel', 'down', 'thrown', 'Peru', 'Bolivia', 'and', 'presumably', 'end', 'in', 'Argentina', 've', 'done', 'lot', 'of', 'research', 'on', 'the', 'countries', 'themselves', 'and', 'know', 'what', 'to', 'expect', 'at', 'least', 'as', 'much', 'as', 'can', 'from', 'the', 'internet', 'alone', 'My', 'problem', 'arose', 'when', 'realized', 'there', 'are', 'no', 'barges', 'that', 'regularly', 'carry', 'passenger', 'vehicles', 'into', 'Panama', 'and', 'then', 'out', 'the', 'other', 'side', 'into', 'Pacific', 'South', 'America', 'Without', 'vehicle', 'not', 'sure', 'how', 'we', 'could', 'travel', 'that', 'long', 'distance', 'but', 'specially', 'considering', 'we', 'had', 'wanted', 'to', 'see', 'all', 'we', 'could', 'along', 'the', 'way', 'came', 'to', 'two', 'conclusions', 'We', 'bite', 'the', 'bullet', 'and', 'fly', 'town', 'to', 'town', 'It', 'would', 'be', 'so', 'expensive', 'it', 'makes', 'me', 'sweat', 'and', 'we', 'miss', 'lot', 'of', 'what', 'we', 'want', 'to', 'see', 'along', 'the', 'way', 'but', 'it', 'hard', 'to', 'imagine', 'option', 'We', 'just', 'drive', 'south', 'to', 'Panama', 'and', 'cross', 'the', 'Darien', 'strait', 'via', 'barge', 'The', 'issue', 'here', 'is', 'that', 'we', 'have', 'soft', 'top', 'jeep', 'and', 'not', 'sure', 'that', 'be', 'the', 'best', 'option', 'given', 'the', 'ease', 'it', 'could', 'be', 'broken', 'into', 'Additionally', 'have', 'read', 'that', 'some', 'of', 'the', 'countries', 'along', 'the', 'way', 'have', 'nosy', 'police', 'who', 'would', 'be', 'happy', 'to', 'stop', 'gringo', 'like', 'myself', 'for', 'bribe', 'to', 'keep', 'going', 'Which', 'of', 'these', 'is', 'advisable', 'given', 'my', 'situation', 'Are', 'there', 'actually', 'vehicle', 'barges', 'don', 'know', 'about', 'that', 'go', 'to', 'Panama', 'and', 'beyond', 'Is', 'there', 'better', 'way', 'to', 'travel', 'across', 'land', 'than', 'by', 'car', 'Is', 'there', 'some', 'third', 'option', 'missing', 'Thanks', 'in', 'advance', 'For', 'additional', 'context', 'we', 'want', 'to', 'see', 'everything', 'these', 'countries', 'have', 'to', 'offer', 'because', 'we', 'plan', 'on', 'moving', 'to', 'one', 'of', 'them', 'in', 'the', 'future', 'and', 'want', 'to', 'see', 'them', 'in', 'their', 'entirety', 'at', 'least', 'as', 'much', 'as', 'you', 'can', 'in', 'one', 'trip']",advice for first international trip to south americaas title say am looking for advice on me and my partner first out of country trip we live in houston but have travelled good bit across the us it look like we re going to come into some money later this year and we wanted to do long trip starting in quito ecuador and travel down thrown peru bolivia and presumably end in argentina ve done lot of research on the country themselves and know what to expect at least a much a can from the internet alone my problem arose when realized there are no barge that regularly carry passenger vehicle into panama and then out the other side into pacific south america without vehicle not sure how we could travel that long distance but specially considering we had wanted to see all we could along the way came to two conclusion we bite the bullet and fly town to town it would be so expensive it make me sweat and we miss lot of what we want to see along the way but it hard to imagine option we just drive south to panama and cross the darien strait via barge the issue here is that we have soft top jeep and not sure that be the best option given the ease it could be broken into additionally have read that some of the country along the way have nosy police who would be happy to stop gringo like myself for bribe to keep going which of these is advisable given my situation are there actually vehicle barge don know about that go to panama and beyond is there better way to travel across land than by car is there some third option missing thanks in advance for additional context we want to see everything these country have to offer because we plan on moving to one of them in the future and want to see them in their entirety at least a much a you can in one trip

travel,"Ibiza - but for mid 30's couple?Wife and I went to Ibiza about 4-5 years ago as part of a 2 week Europe trip. Although we only spent a couple of nights there, we loved it. Being by the beach during the day, and then partying until the sun came up was fun. We had the party mindset and were really surprised how many families were around vs young partiers. 

Now were older :( but still want to be fun. No way we can keep up with our younger selves. We are booking an anniversary trip and want something that has that tropical island feel, a good night life scene, but also is a little more relaxed.

travel,"3 Weeks in Europe - Itinerary Thoughts?Hi everyone! 

My partner and I are going to Europe together for three weeks (23 days) at the end of August. We have flights booked to fly in and out of Paris. Nothing else is booked, but we would like to spend the majority of the time in the Mediterranean.

Must haves on this trip: good food, nature, sunny and warm, history
Nice to haves: beaches, adventures, good wine

Our plan right now is:
4x nights - Paris
3x nights - Marseille
3x nights - Mallorca
4x nights - Barcelona
1x night - Naples
6x nights - Amalfi Coast 
2x nights - Paris 

I have three questions:

1) is that enough time in all of these places to enjoy them?

2) is a budget of 5,000 USD enough for this trip (excluding flights to and from Europe). We want to stay in air bnbs and hotels but won't be balling out.

3) do you think these places will be able to fulfil the must haves and nice to haves I listed above?

Any other thoughts are really appreciated!","['Weeks', 'in', 'Europe', 'Itinerary', 'Thoughts', 'Hi', 'everyone', 'My', 'partner', 'and', 'are', 'going', 'to', 'Europe', 'together', 'for', 'three', 'weeks', 'days', 'at', 'the', 'end', 'of', 'August', 'We', 'have', 'flights', 'booked', 'to', 'fly', 'in', 'and', 'out', 'of', 'Paris', 'Nothing', 'else', 'is', 'booked', 'but', 'we', 'would', 'like', 'to', 'spend', 'the', 'majority', 'of', 'the', 'time', 'in', 'the', 'Mediterranean', 'Must', 'haves', 'on', 'this', 'trip', 'good', 'food', 'nature', 'sunny', 'and', 'warm', 'history', 'Nice', 'to', 'haves', 'beaches', 'adventures', 'good', 'wine', 'Our', 'plan', 'right', 'now', 'is', '4x', 'nights', 'Paris', '3x', 'nights', 'Marseille', '3x', 'nights', 'Mallorca', '4x', 'nights', 'Barcelona', '1x', 'night', 'Naples', '6x', 'nights', 'Amalfi', 'Coast', '2x', 'nights', 'Paris', 'have', 'three', 'questions', 'is', 'that', 'enough', 'time', 'in', 'all', 'of', 'these', 'places', 'to', 'enjoy', 'them', 'is', 'budget', 'of', 'USD', 'enough', 'for', 'this', 'trip', 'excluding', 'flights', 'to', 'and', 'from', 'Europe', 'We', 'want', 'to', 'stay', 'in', 'air', 'bnbs', 'and', 'hotels', 'but', 'won', 'be', 'balling', 'out', 'do', 'you', 'think', 'these', 'places', 'will', 'be', 'able', 'to', 'fulfil', 'the', 'must', 'haves', 'and', 'nice', 'to', 'haves', 'listed', 'above', 'Any', 'other', 'thoughts', 'are', 'really', 'appreciated']",weeks in europe itinerary thoughts hi everyone my partner and are going to europe together for three week day at the end of august we have flight booked to fly in and out of paris nothing else is booked but we would like to spend the majority of the time in the mediterranean must have on this trip good food nature sunny and warm history nice to have beach adventure good wine our plan right now is 4x night paris 3x night marseille 3x night mallorca 4x night barcelona 1x night naples 6x night amalfi coast 2x night paris have three question is that enough time in all of these place to enjoy them is budget of usd enough for this trip excluding flight to and from europe we want to stay in air bnbs and hotel but won be balling out do you think these place will be able to fulfil the must have and nice to have listed above any other thought are really appreciated

I know that Bosnia also has a cool jungle forest, but I don’t know what would be interesting to visit for a hike.

travel,"Canceling a non-refundable hotel reservation due to unresponsiveness?Hi all. I unfortunately booked a non-refundable hotel reservation 2 months in advance in Greece. The hotel has many duplicate websites and postings and I chose one that I thought was their main website that had the best rate. There is an email on the website and I've emailed them asking if they would possibly cancel with no cost. I've tried emailing throughout this week with no response.

However, when I go to Airbnb and message the host on that website, they respond but tell me they do not discuss other websites' reservations on Airbnb.

So basically, I'm unhappy with the reservation and would like to cancel to rebook elsewhere. They have NOT charged my credit card yet but they have my card on file. Perhaps if I press the cancel button on the website, it will automatically charge my card.

I like walking a lot and exploring the city. I'll spend a few days in each city.

travel,"Interesting behavior on planesI always like to chat with flight attendants about their job and their experience. 

I recently found out that tons of people actually like to roam the cabin and bathrooms barefoot! I really don’t understand the logic or want behind this.

Does anyone here actually roam barefoot in the bathrooms? Do wet floors bother you?

I’m genuinely curious how someone can bring themselves to do it knowing the floors could be absolutely filthy. Also bathroom floors could be covered in only God knows what. Hopefully it’s just some urine. 

According to the flight attendants I spoke to, it’s quite common.

travel,"Need help deciding where to honey moon! Options are Amalfi Coast/Capri, Greek islands, or SicilyHi all. My fiancé and I are planning our honeymoon for this summer. We were originally going to postpone the honeymoon to next year but we decided it can make it work this year. We’ve narrowed down our options to Amalfi coast/a few days in Capri, the Greek islands (specifically Santorini and Mykonos), or Sicily. I know a lot of people are going to say it depends on what you want to do. I would say all we plan on doing is light exploring, relaxing on the beach/by the water, and enjoying nightlife. Other than that, we aren’t picky. While I understand this is more of a personal preference, we would just love to hear some opinions on our potentially once in a lifetime trip!

travel,"What is the cheapest way to travel to Germany, Köln?I’m from Romania and there is a concert I must to go happening in september, but it is in Köln, and the tickets for planes there are enormously expensive. I’m a minor, so I cant have any DiscoverEU passes or anything so I would have to pay for transportation.
The cheapest way I found so far is going to Bologna (a ticket is like 5 to 10$ max) then go to Köln from there (a flight is like 30$), so that would be like a total of max 80$ just for flying, which is still a little too high for me. Do you guys know any alternatives? I’ll even walk a hundred miles if it means its the cheapest way. Any city/country that has cheap flights/ buses or anything? Thanks in advance.

travel,"Travelling light - what do you recommend for hand luggage?I'm looking to do some globetrotting come September and I'm interested in collecting patches for my bag as souvenirs. So it would be great if I could use one backpack for as much of my travel as possible - one that I can live out of for shorter trips or pair with a small wheeled case if I go to a big city or something. I would prefer to take it into flights as hand luggage if possible. I don't plan on long-trip backpacking or hiking.

I'm trying to pick a backpack I'll like but I'm not sure what dimensions I should look for as I know airlines have different policies on this sort of thing.

I'm an American that had surgery in Thailand in October of last year. The surgical wound has not healed and before I left Thailand in March, the doctor was recommending follow up surgery (sphincterotomy).

I'm now back in the US and am trying to assess my options. It seems like follow up surgery might be necessary. I do not have US health insurance being that I'm abroad for the majority of the year.

travel,"Thailand (First Time)Greetings!

Never been to Thailand before. I would like to go there at the end of the year or next year as I hear it’s the sex capital of the Milky Way (and possibly the entire Universe)… My Uncle has been going there for 30+ years and he says its great!

I’ve been dabbling in Sex Tourism for a few years now, in Gambia… but I wanna do Thailand now, because it’s supposed to be like Mecca for Sex Tourists

I’ve watched many videos on youtube of the nightlife in Thailand. There are many beautiful freelancers and bar girls around places like Pattaya and Phuket

HOWEVER… I prefer my females to be mature (aged 45+)… so I was wondering if there are any bars or places I can find lots of mature females hanging around?

Also… How much money is enough if I go for 2 weeks? I’m pretty frugal, I only eat OMAD, I mostly walk instead of taxis, I’m willing to stay in the cheapest place possible (no room sharing tho), and I want 2 mature females a day

My wife is obsessed and recently watched a travel vlog of a whale watching company out of Baja and I’d like to get her something similar for her birthday or anniversary. I’d prefer to stay CONUS or eastern CONUS if possible, but am open to nearby (Mexico/Canada) suggestions. 

Definitely want something animal and environmentally friendly, and would ideally like a time and place suggestion that maximizes her chance of actually seeing one.

travel,"Expedia trying to screw me out of my trip to Thailand trip.I booked a trip to Thailand a few months ago and I got well priced tickets. I discovered when double checking my itinerary that my outbound flight to Thailand was not showing up on any of the airlines website. I called expedia and they said the airlines canceled the flights (not true). This has happened three times now and each time they say the airline has ""canceled"" the flight they do not reach out to me at all. I would have had no way of knowing expedia was canceling my booking if I were not checking. I would have shown up to the airport and there would have been no ticket. Every time I have called I get no answers and they book me the exact trip, only to cancel it a day later.

I leave this weekend and this has still not been resolved. I suspect Expedia does not want to honor the ticket price I got so they keep *lying* to me about the airlines canceling the flights, which I can see as clear as day they are not. I am sitting here with no solution, hitting brick wall after brick wall. I just wanted to share my experience in having to continuously sit on hold for hours on end for Expedia to cancel my outbound flights to Bangkok and to warn others about what Expedia may be doing.","['Expedia', 'trying', 'to', 'screw', 'me', 'out', 'of', 'my', 'trip', 'to', 'Thailand', 'trip', 'booked', 'trip', 'to', 'Thailand', 'few', 'months', 'ago', 'and', 'got', 'well', 'priced', 'tickets', 'discovered', 'when', 'double', 'checking', 'my', 'itinerary', 'that', 'my', 'outbound', 'flight', 'to', 'Thailand', 'was', 'not', 'showing', 'up', 'on', 'any', 'of', 'the', 'airlines', 'website', 'called', 'expedia', 'and', 'they', 'said', 'the', 'airlines', 'canceled', 'the', 'flights', 'not', 'true', 'This', 'has', 'happened', 'three', 'times', 'now', 'and', 'each', 'time', 'they', 'say', 'the', 'airline', 'has', 'canceled', 'the', 'flight', 'they', 'do', 'not', 'reach', 'out', 'to', 'me', 'at', 'all', 'would', 'have', 'had', 'no', 'way', 'of', 'knowing', 'expedia', 'was', 'canceling', 'my', 'booking', 'if', 'were', 'not', 'checking', 'would', 'have', 'shown', 'up', 'to', 'the', 'airport', 'and', 'there', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'no', 'ticket', 'Every', 'time', 'have', 'called', 'get', 'no', 'answers', 'and', 'they', 'book', 'me', 'the', 'exact', 'trip', 'only', 'to', 'cancel', 'it', 'day', 'later', 'leave', 'this', 'weekend', 'and', 'this', 'has', 'still', 'not', 'been', 'resolved', 'suspect', 'Expedia', 'does', 'not', 'want', 'to', 'honor', 'the', 'ticket', 'price', 'got', 'so', 'they', 'keep', 'lying', 'to', 'me', 'about', 'the', 'airlines', 'canceling', 'the', 'flights', 'which', 'can', 'see', 'as', 'clear', 'as', 'day', 'they', 'are', 'not', 'am', 'sitting', 'here', 'with', 'no', 'solution', 'hitting', 'brick', 'wall', 'after', 'brick', 'wall', 'just', 'wanted', 'to', 'share', 'my', 'experience', 'in', 'having', 'to', 'continuously', 'sit', 'on', 'hold', 'for', 'hours', 'on', 'end', 'for', 'Expedia', 'to', 'cancel', 'my', 'outbound', 'flights', 'to', 'Bangkok', 'and', 'to', 'warn', 'others', 'about', 'what', 'Expedia', 'may', 'be', 'doing']",expedia trying to screw me out of my trip to thailand trip booked trip to thailand few month ago and got well priced ticket discovered when double checking my itinerary that my outbound flight to thailand wa not showing up on any of the airline website called expedia and they said the airline canceled the flight not true this ha happened three time now and each time they say the airline ha canceled the flight they do not reach out to me at all would have had no way of knowing expedia wa canceling my booking if were not checking would have shown up to the airport and there would have been no ticket every time have called get no answer and they book me the exact trip only to cancel it day later leave this weekend and this ha still not been resolved suspect expedia doe not want to honor the ticket price got so they keep lying to me about the airline canceling the flight which can see a clear a day they are not am sitting here with no solution hitting brick wall after brick wall just wanted to share my experience in having to continuously sit on hold for hour on end for expedia to cancel my outbound flight to bangkok and to warn others about what expedia may be doing

travel,"France and Spain with toddlersGood morning all, we are planning a trip to Europe this fall. The trip is centered around a big family gathering in Provence,  it we will be flying in two weeks early to do some travel before meeting up with the big party. My wife and I have done quite a bit of travel throughout Europe, but that was when our lives fit in backpacks and we could jump from city to city with ease. We are now toting along 2 little ones aged 3 &amp; 1 (at the time of the trip) and all the accoutrements that comes with children. Obviously we will have to change up our travel habits a bit to accommodate. I’d love to hear recommendations from those with experience. Everything from packing tips, things to bring (or not), unexpected surprises found along the way, and what kind of activities you found. We have always loved museums, but our 3 year old is hyperactive and exceptionally loud so I’d prefer not to ruin others enjoyment as they take in fine art 😂. We haven’t firmed up an itinerary other than flying into Madrid and then having two weeks to make our way up to Paris before hopping on a train South. We are thinking of some time at San Sebastián and maybe working along the Bay of Biscay before hitting the train to Paris.

travel,"Comprehensive Health InsuranceI've tried searching on here, googling, reading through various insurer websites (inc. Safety Wing, GeoBlue, and a bunch of others). I'm trying to find health insurance for a US-based family of 3 while we are on vacation in the UK.

Specifically: we want health insurance that would not only cover big/emergency things, but also if our kid is sick and we want to go see a primary care physician and get a prescription etc. 

Struggling to find providers for this purpose. Safety Wing, for example, seems like it's only for hospitalizations and stuff? Maybe I'm mistaken.

travel,"Help with ItineraryHiya! I’m travelling (half) solo to the Philippines for the first time in June, and wanted some feedback about my itinerary, am I missing anything awesome? Is it realistic? Any ideas for what to do while here? 
I want to do a lot of snorkelling, free diving, waterfall chasing and beach bumming (though I know the weather won’t be the best for it). I’m planning on staying in super budget hostels (the most expensive one being £10 per night, but most being more around £5). I don’t have a licence and so I’m gonna be relying on habal habals, taxis and a whole lot of walking. Im willing to pay a decent amount on a trip or experience if it’s super worthwhile, and ideally water based. 

Any advice is helpful!

Coron - 3 nights

El Nido - 4 nights 

Port Barton - 5 nights 

Puerto princessa - 1 night

travel,"Airlines are making travel unnecessarily stressfulSince the pandemic airlines have gone to absolute shit, and it’s across the board so there’s no way to avoid it. Airlines don’t care because people are still flying since there are no other options if you want to travel.   


Expensive flights, endless delays, and literally no customer service. The new norm is flight downgraded or rescheduled, no refund, and 3-4 hours on the phone to figure it out.   


Three of my last four flights had major issues due to overbooking and staffing cuts that could‘ve been entirely avoidable. Last time a bunch of us had our flight rescheduled last minute from direct to connecting with the first flight delayed. When people were asking the person at the gate for help, she claimed there was nothing that could be done and told everyone to sit down. When a lady asked her if she could contact the gate at the connecting airport to hold the flight, she told her if she didn’t sit down she’d throw her off the flight lol.

&amp;#x200B;

I’m not expecting 4-5 star service but airlines can seriously get away with treating their customers like crap and I’ve witnessed way more unruly employees than passengers lately. And yeah there’s travel insurance, but that doesn’t help when your travel plan gets thrown off and it also doesn’t help that much with the stress of a horrible trip. I’ll be reducing the amount of travel I do and sticking entirely to domestic travel until things improve.","['Airlines', 'are', 'making', 'travel', 'unnecessarily', 'stressfulSince', 'the', 'pandemic', 'airlines', 'have', 'gone', 'to', 'absolute', 'shit', 'and', 'it', 'across', 'the', 'board', 'so', 'there', 'no', 'way', 'to', 'avoid', 'it', 'Airlines', 'don', 'care', 'because', 'people', 'are', 'still', 'flying', 'since', 'there', 'are', 'no', 'other', 'options', 'if', 'you', 'want', 'to', 'travel', 'Expensive', 'flights', 'endless', 'delays', 'and', 'literally', 'no', 'customer', 'service', 'The', 'new', 'norm', 'is', 'flight', 'downgraded', 'or', 'rescheduled', 'no', 'refund', 'and', 'hours', 'on', 'the', 'phone', 'to', 'figure', 'it', 'out', 'Three', 'of', 'my', 'last', 'four', 'flights', 'had', 'major', 'issues', 'due', 'to', 'overbooking', 'and', 'staffing', 'cuts', 'that', 'could', 've', 'been', 'entirely', 'avoidable', 'Last', 'time', 'bunch', 'of', 'us', 'had', 'our', 'flight', 'rescheduled', 'last', 'minute', 'from', 'direct', 'to', 'connecting', 'with', 'the', 'first', 'flight', 'delayed', 'When', 'people', 'were', 'asking', 'the', 'person', 'at', 'the', 'gate', 'for', 'help', 'she', 'claimed', 'there', 'was', 'nothing', 'that', 'could', 'be', 'done', 'and', 'told', 'everyone', 'to', 'sit', 'down', 'When', 'lady', 'asked', 'her', 'if', 'she', 'could', 'contact', 'the', 'gate', 'at', 'the', 'connecting', 'airport', 'to', 'hold', 'the', 'flight', 'she', 'told', 'her', 'if', 'she', 'didn', 'sit', 'down', 'she', 'throw', 'her', 'off', 'the', 'flight', 'lol', 'amp', 'x200B', 'not', 'expecting', 'star', 'service', 'but', 'airlines', 'can', 'seriously', 'get', 'away', 'with', 'treating', 'their', 'customers', 'like', 'crap', 'and', 've', 'witnessed', 'way', 'more', 'unruly', 'employees', 'than', 'passengers', 'lately', 'And', 'yeah', 'there', 'travel', 'insurance', 'but', 'that', 'doesn', 'help', 'when', 'your', 'travel', 'plan', 'gets', 'thrown', 'off', 'and', 'it', 'also', 'doesn', 'help', 'that', 'much', 'with', 'the', 'stress', 'of', 'horrible', 'trip', 'll', 'be', 'reducing', 'the', 'amount', 'of', 'travel', 'do', 'and', 'sticking', 'entirely', 'to', 'domestic', 'travel', 'until', 'things', 'improve']",airlines are making travel unnecessarily stressfulsince the pandemic airline have gone to absolute shit and it across the board so there no way to avoid it airlines don care because people are still flying since there are no other option if you want to travel expensive flight endless delay and literally no customer service the new norm is flight downgraded or rescheduled no refund and hour on the phone to figure it out three of my last four flight had major issue due to overbooking and staffing cut that could ve been entirely avoidable last time bunch of u had our flight rescheduled last minute from direct to connecting with the first flight delayed when people were asking the person at the gate for help she claimed there wa nothing that could be done and told everyone to sit down when lady asked her if she could contact the gate at the connecting airport to hold the flight she told her if she didn sit down she throw her off the flight lol amp x200b not expecting star service but airline can seriously get away with treating their customer like crap and ve witnessed way more unruly employee than passenger lately and yeah there travel insurance but that doesn help when your travel plan get thrown off and it also doesn help that much with the stress of horrible trip ll be reducing the amount of travel do and sticking entirely to domestic travel until thing improve

travel,"Most EPIC travel/ flying experience saving $$$A few years back, I had to fly to Seoul, Korea from NYC. My partner at the time is from Istanbul, Turkey, and the direct flights from NYC to Istanbul were close to $2k one way. Doing extensive research, I found a flight from NYC to Seoul with a layover in Istanbul for $850. I told my bf to book this flight with me and abandon the Istanbul to Seoul flight. So he ended up saving more than $1k on the exact same flight with the same airlines. I intentionally chose a 3-day layover so that I could explore Istanbul with my ex. I had an amazing trip in Istanbul, and when I was ready to fly back to Seoul, they told me that my flight was OVERBOOKED! They gave me $750, paid for my hotel and transportation, and I got to stay for another day!

&amp;#x200B;

So I practically traveled to Istanbul for 4 days for free (hotel and flights).

travel,"Mistake in Passport and Upcoming TravelHello all! Quick Question, 

My family is planning to take our boat over to the Bahamas (Likely freeport) from the Florida Coast this June. I have not gone with them as I have always had school/sports etc. I (20F) am now in college and have the time off to go. We have not secured a date by it is likely going to be the 2nd/3rd week in June. I just took a deeper look at my passport as I was getting the numbers for the paperwork and saw they misprinted ""JR"" on my name. I am not a JR and no of my other documents say JR. I went back and looked at my original application and I never checked JR so I have NO IDEA how that got there. My concern is if I send it in now to get fixed, it wont be back before June. From what I am reading online, the turn around time is anywhere from 3-7 weeks with expedited service. So hers what I know...

[https://www.us-passport-service-guide.com/passport-corrections.html#:\~:text=When%20you%20submit%20a%20DS,use%20two%2Dway%20express%20mail](https://www.us-passport-service-guide.com/passport-corrections.html#:~:text=When%20you%20submit%20a%20DS,use%20two%2Dway%20express%20mail).

This website says "" It is usually possible to travel internationally with small data errors in a passport."" It also says to write ""expedited passport correction/misprint"" outside the envelope for a 3 week turnaround but I don't know if I should trust that. Does anyone have an experience with this? 

HELP I don't know if I should say F it and just travel with the JR or not risk it and send it in (and risk it not coming back in time) I would like to add that we are traveling on a personal boat, that is registered to my step father, with about 10 other people who all have correct passports. I also have used this passport to fly Florida to Vegas but not out of the country. The passport is less than 1 year old, but more than 90 days.

travel,"RyanairHi all,

I want to bring double kids trolley in Ryanair. I have contacted them and one worker says its free of charge another worker says I have to buy luggage as if I will take **bike** with me. Have you any experience in transporting ""sports equipment"" using Ryanair?

It seems it should be free of charge. I have 2 month baby boy and 2,5 year old daughter. Children are entitled to free trolley, but one is bigger (wider) and its also a little expensive I do not want it to get sratched od thrown.

I am willing to pay extra but I want it to reach destination safe.

The current plan is a night or two in Malta, then head to Italy, where we will likely spend the bulk of the trip. Places like Naples and Florence sound interesting.

Here are some questions you may be able to help me with:

\- How many nights should we spend in each country? I'm currently thinking 1 or 2 in Malta, 2 to 4 in Croatia, and the rest in Italy.

\- We really like good food, shopping, interesting or unique places. We are not into hiking or partying. Which cities/towns should we consider?

However, he realized his passport will expire 4 and half months upon entry to Colombia. So we were questioning whether we would have any problems entering Colombia, because, the [travel.gov](https://travel.gov) websites says that it ""strongly recommends"" 6 months passport validity upon entering Colombia. We only plan on staying there for a week.   


Does anyone have experience with entering Bogota when his/her passport is set to expire without the 6 months validity? Will the border control turn us away? Will we be able to board our flight?  


If anyone could shed light on this, I would greatly appreciate it, thank you!","['Hello', 'traveling', 'to', 'Bogota', 'Colombia', 'and', 'have', 'question', 'regarding', 'passport', 'validitySo', 'my', 'buddy', 'and', 'are', 'planning', 'on', 'traveling', 'to', 'Colombia', 'However', 'he', 'realized', 'his', 'passport', 'will', 'expire', 'and', 'half', 'months', 'upon', 'entry', 'to', 'Colombia', 'So', 'we', 'were', 'questioning', 'whether', 'we', 'would', 'have', 'any', 'problems', 'entering', 'Colombia', 'because', 'the', 'travel', 'gov', 'https', 'travel', 'gov', 'websites', 'says', 'that', 'it', 'strongly', 'recommends', 'months', 'passport', 'validity', 'upon', 'entering', 'Colombia', 'We', 'only', 'plan', 'on', 'staying', 'there', 'for', 'week', 'Does', 'anyone', 'have', 'experience', 'with', 'entering', 'Bogota', 'when', 'his', 'her', 'passport', 'is', 'set', 'to', 'expire', 'without', 'the', 'months', 'validity', 'Will', 'the', 'border', 'control', 'turn', 'us', 'away', 'Will', 'we', 'be', 'able', 'to', 'board', 'our', 'flight', 'If', 'anyone', 'could', 'shed', 'light', 'on', 'this', 'would', 'greatly', 'appreciate', 'it', 'thank', 'you']",hello traveling to bogota colombia and have question regarding passport validityso my buddy and are planning on traveling to colombia however he realized his passport will expire and half month upon entry to colombia so we were questioning whether we would have any problem entering colombia because the travel gov http travel gov website say that it strongly recommends month passport validity upon entering colombia we only plan on staying there for week does anyone have experience with entering bogota when his her passport is set to expire without the month validity will the border control turn u away will we be able to board our flight if anyone could shed light on this would greatly appreciate it thank you

travel,"Best way to travel from Frankfurt to Paris same day after coming from overseas (train vs plane)I'm arriving from USA to Frankfurt on May 28 at 10:50am.

&amp;#x200B;

I was looking at either taking a train that leaves from Frankfurt airport at 12:52pm and arriving in Paris Gare de l'Est at 4:54pm with one 19 minute transfer at Mannheim Hbf.

&amp;#x200B;

Other option was taking an Air France flight leaving at 2:15pm from FRA and arriving at CDG around 3:45pm. I was considering a few options to get to Paris (staying by the Opera house) by either reserving a taxi ahead of time, calling and uber or taking the RER.

&amp;#x200B;

My concern with the train is the transfer time and my ability to carry luggage without having it get stolen. How worried should I be about this after potentially being tired from travel especially if I'm traveling solo?

My concern with the flight is potential delays I might face. I know it's the same day as the Champions League final so I'm wondering if I should be worried about traffic, flight delays, or anything else unexpected?

I'm not too concerned about price since I estimated that both options will be close enough with all things considered.

travel,"Europe Sim Card + Turkey QuestionsI am traveling to Europe (about 1 month), visiting France, Italy, Greece, Turkey, Hungary, Germany

Right now, in my home country, there is an EU prepaid sim card that works in multiple EU countries (excluding turkey), that I can buy. 

1) It cost 22 euros for 40GB 4G/3G unlimited calls &amp; sms (though I don’t think calls and sms are useful). 
2) there is also a sim card for turkey which cost 15 euros 2GB/day for 5 days (no calls no sms).

My requirement is to have high data 30-40gb for my entire trip would be good. 

I am just wondering would it be a good idea to buy these 2 sim cards for my trip? Or will it be better to purchase EU sims in France and Turkish sims in Turkey?

Lastly, during my trip I will also need to do a zoom presentation in one of my days while I’m in cortina d'ampezzo (italian alps). If the 4G is strong enough there. Will the 4G be better for a locally purchased EU sim card? Or the one I buy from my phone country be sufficient?

travel,"Countries with good hostel network and fun for solo travelers? Please read :)I have 2 weeks vacation and was planning on visiting Europe in June (probably early June, but am flexible). I just can’t decide where! 

I’m 24 and this would be my first time doing hostel style travel. I work as a software engineer so I’m trying to get out and meet people. 

And although I don’t want to be partying 24/7, I do want to get out of my comfort zone and party a little. I never got to party in college. I want to do it while I’m still relatively young

Wants:

- Tons of sightseeing, beautiful views and architecture 
- Warm climate and beaches are a plus. But not totally required
- Good hostel/social scene (parties are a plus)

Idk how to narrow down the places I’m interested in seeing. Ive already been to Paris, London, Prague, and Vienna. So far the places that interest me are:

- Amsterdam, NL and nearby Belgium (Bruges, Ghent, Antwerp). Amsterdam seems cool because of all the museums and beautiful rivers, and Bruges just looks like straight out of a storybook.

- Berlin, Germany (heard great things about the clubs, but besides that doesn’t seem very interesting to me at first glance). Not as nice scenery. I could be wrong tho!

- Budapest, Hungary. Like Berlin with cool Ruin bars. But not as scenic as like Greek islands or parts of Spain/Italy. Could pair this with 

- Spain and Portugal in general. Feel like it has a good mix of beauty, party, sightseeing.

- Italy, same as Spain. Although I hear the hostel scene isn’t as good there?

- Greece, this looks so freaking beautiful (especially Santorini, but is it good for solo traveling or is more for couples?)

Others that seem cool: Istanbul Turkey, Scotland, Croatia, Slovenia, and Southern France. I don’t mind combining countries if doable 

Budget: $8,000 but I doubt I would get anywhere near that.","['Countries', 'with', 'good', 'hostel', 'network', 'and', 'fun', 'for', 'solo', 'travelers', 'Please', 'read', 'have', 'weeks', 'vacation', 'and', 'was', 'planning', 'on', 'visiting', 'Europe', 'in', 'June', 'probably', 'early', 'June', 'but', 'am', 'flexible', 'just', 'can', 'decide', 'where', 'and', 'this', 'would', 'be', 'my', 'first', 'time', 'doing', 'hostel', 'style', 'travel', 'work', 'as', 'software', 'engineer', 'so', 'trying', 'to', 'get', 'out', 'and', 'meet', 'people', 'And', 'although', 'don', 'want', 'to', 'be', 'partying', 'do', 'want', 'to', 'get', 'out', 'of', 'my', 'comfort', 'zone', 'and', 'party', 'little', 'never', 'got', 'to', 'party', 'in', 'college', 'want', 'to', 'do', 'it', 'while', 'still', 'relatively', 'young', 'Wants', 'Tons', 'of', 'sightseeing', 'beautiful', 'views', 'and', 'architecture', 'Warm', 'climate', 'and', 'beaches', 'are', 'plus', 'But', 'not', 'totally', 'required', 'Good', 'hostel', 'social', 'scene', 'parties', 'are', 'plus', 'Idk', 'how', 'to', 'narrow', 'down', 'the', 'places', 'interested', 'in', 'seeing', 'Ive', 'already', 'been', 'to', 'Paris', 'London', 'Prague', 'and', 'Vienna', 'So', 'far', 'the', 'places', 'that', 'interest', 'me', 'are', 'Amsterdam', 'NL', 'and', 'nearby', 'Belgium', 'Bruges', 'Ghent', 'Antwerp', 'Amsterdam', 'seems', 'cool', 'because', 'of', 'all', 'the', 'museums', 'and', 'beautiful', 'rivers', 'and', 'Bruges', 'just', 'looks', 'like', 'straight', 'out', 'of', 'storybook', 'Berlin', 'Germany', 'heard', 'great', 'things', 'about', 'the', 'clubs', 'but', 'besides', 'that', 'doesn', 'seem', 'very', 'interesting', 'to', 'me', 'at', 'first', 'glance', 'Not', 'as', 'nice', 'scenery', 'could', 'be', 'wrong', 'tho', 'Budapest', 'Hungary', 'Like', 'Berlin', 'with', 'cool', 'Ruin', 'bars', 'But', 'not', 'as', 'scenic', 'as', 'like', 'Greek', 'islands', 'or', 'parts', 'of', 'Spain', 'Italy', 'Could', 'pair', 'this', 'with', 'Spain', 'and', 'Portugal', 'in', 'general', 'Feel', 'like', 'it', 'has', 'good', 'mix', 'of', 'beauty', 'party', 'sightseeing', 'Italy', 'same', 'as', 'Spain', 'Although', 'hear', 'the', 'hostel', 'scene', 'isn', 'as', 'good', 'there', 'Greece', 'this', 'looks', 'so', 'freaking', 'beautiful', 'especially', 'Santorini', 'but', 'is', 'it', 'good', 'for', 'solo', 'traveling', 'or', 'is', 'more', 'for', 'couples', 'Others', 'that', 'seem', 'cool', 'Istanbul', 'Turkey', 'Scotland', 'Croatia', 'Slovenia', 'and', 'Southern', 'France', 'don', 'mind', 'combining', 'countries', 'if', 'doable', 'Budget', 'but', 'doubt', 'would', 'get', 'anywhere', 'near', 'that']",countries with good hostel network and fun for solo traveler please read have week vacation and wa planning on visiting europe in june probably early june but am flexible just can decide where and this would be my first time doing hostel style travel work a software engineer so trying to get out and meet people and although don want to be partying do want to get out of my comfort zone and party little never got to party in college want to do it while still relatively young wants tons of sightseeing beautiful view and architecture warm climate and beach are plus but not totally required good hostel social scene party are plus idk how to narrow down the place interested in seeing ive already been to paris london prague and vienna so far the place that interest me are amsterdam nl and nearby belgium bruges ghent antwerp amsterdam seems cool because of all the museum and beautiful river and bruges just look like straight out of storybook berlin germany heard great thing about the club but besides that doesn seem very interesting to me at first glance not a nice scenery could be wrong tho budapest hungary like berlin with cool ruin bar but not a scenic a like greek island or part of spain italy could pair this with spain and portugal in general feel like it ha good mix of beauty party sightseeing italy same a spain although hear the hostel scene isn a good there greece this look so freaking beautiful especially santorini but is it good for solo traveling or is more for couple others that seem cool istanbul turkey scotland croatia slovenia and southern france don mind combining country if doable budget but doubt would get anywhere near that

travel,"Hiking the complete Great Wall of ChinaHey there all, 

So as the title explains, I've just had a thought about hiking the complete 21,000km of The Great Wall of China and I'm curious as to whether or not anybody on this forum has attempted it. So I'm an Australian (23m) and I'm sure I'd need to apply for visas etc and military passes as sections of the wall get close to military grounds. Just feeling my way and keen to know more. 

I've read a few forums about a handful of people attempting it and thought it would be a wicked experience.  If anyone has, lettuce snow and drop a comment below!

But, seven hours into this miserable flight, the kind flight person brought me a package. And in this package, was a sandwich. It was unlabeled, and its contents are unfamiliar to my midwestern American knowledge of what makes a sandwich. I want to say... cream cheese and something else? I don't know. Please, help me.

It also came with a side dish of another food... I ate it with a spoon but I also don't know what it was.

hi all. i applied for my passport in early feb, expedited it, it said it would be here march 6th. ive been calling about trying to get it in time for my study abroad program that starts may 4th for a month now. they originally told me to fill out the ds-(?)8 form, now as of a couple weeks ago, they’re saying it’s too late to do so. 

i just received my tracking number from them today after begging them on the phone to finally give it to me, it says delivered but no, i didn’t receive it. i received my supporting documents back early this month, but nothing since.

i have to leave in a couple of weeks and since no one in my family has ever left the country i genuinely don’t know what to do. does anyone have any advice on what steps i should take now? are there overnight passport services? i live in ohio and don’t know of any, but i’m willing to even fly to the west coast to be able to get it as soon as possible. the passport agencies aren’t helping at all so any advice will help and thank you.","['passport', 'advice', 'sorry', 'if', 'this', 'is', 'weird', 'place', 'to', 'post', 'this', 'but', 'trying', 'to', 'find', 'more', 'active', 'community', 'to', 'post', 'this', 'in', 'so', 'thank', 'you', 'hi', 'all', 'applied', 'for', 'my', 'passport', 'in', 'early', 'feb', 'expedited', 'it', 'it', 'said', 'it', 'would', 'be', 'here', 'march', '6th', 'ive', 'been', 'calling', 'about', 'trying', 'to', 'get', 'it', 'in', 'time', 'for', 'my', 'study', 'abroad', 'program', 'that', 'starts', 'may', '4th', 'for', 'month', 'now', 'they', 'originally', 'told', 'me', 'to', 'fill', 'out', 'the', 'ds', 'form', 'now', 'as', 'of', 'couple', 'weeks', 'ago', 'they', 're', 'saying', 'it', 'too', 'late', 'to', 'do', 'so', 'just', 'received', 'my', 'tracking', 'number', 'from', 'them', 'today', 'after', 'begging', 'them', 'on', 'the', 'phone', 'to', 'finally', 'give', 'it', 'to', 'me', 'it', 'says', 'delivered', 'but', 'no', 'didn', 'receive', 'it', 'received', 'my', 'supporting', 'documents', 'back', 'early', 'this', 'month', 'but', 'nothing', 'since', 'have', 'to', 'leave', 'in', 'couple', 'of', 'weeks', 'and', 'since', 'no', 'one', 'in', 'my', 'family', 'has', 'ever', 'left', 'the', 'country', 'genuinely', 'don', 'know', 'what', 'to', 'do', 'does', 'anyone', 'have', 'any', 'advice', 'on', 'what', 'steps', 'should', 'take', 'now', 'are', 'there', 'overnight', 'passport', 'services', 'live', 'in', 'ohio', 'and', 'don', 'know', 'of', 'any', 'but', 'willing', 'to', 'even', 'fly', 'to', 'the', 'west', 'coast', 'to', 'be', 'able', 'to', 'get', 'it', 'as', 'soon', 'as', 'possible', 'the', 'passport', 'agencies', 'aren', 'helping', 'at', 'all', 'so', 'any', 'advice', 'will', 'help', 'and', 'thank', 'you']",passport advice sorry if this is weird place to post this but trying to find more active community to post this in so thank you hi all applied for my passport in early feb expedited it it said it would be here march 6th ive been calling about trying to get it in time for my study abroad program that start may 4th for month now they originally told me to fill out the d form now a of couple week ago they re saying it too late to do so just received my tracking number from them today after begging them on the phone to finally give it to me it say delivered but no didn receive it received my supporting document back early this month but nothing since have to leave in couple of week and since no one in my family ha ever left the country genuinely don know what to do doe anyone have any advice on what step should take now are there overnight passport service live in ohio and don know of any but willing to even fly to the west coast to be able to get it a soon a possible the passport agency aren helping at all so any advice will help and thank you

* Any advice on places to stay?

travel,"Looking for Recos: Vegetarian-Friendly Restaurants in Portugal 🇵🇹🥗🍋I’m heading to Portugal for a honeymoon trip! It’s also our first time in Europe! We want to know if anyone has vegetarian or vegetarian-friendly restaurant recos.

We’ll be there for 2 weeks:
• a few days in Faro/Porto
• a few in Lisbon/Sintra
• a few in the Algarves ending in Faro

My partner is a vegetarian (fine with eggs). I’m worried every meal there might be seafood/beef/chicken/pork.

Any suggestions? Or observations about what to expect? Should my partner expect to live off bread and olives for our trip? Haha

&amp;#x200B;

1) Safety wing will not sell us insurance while we are in washington state (or maryland or florida). It says we can buy it when we leave.  But we are flying to LA and then miami, does that mean if we buy it in LA like it suggests, it would then be voided because we went to LA?

2) Safety wing doesnt include a couple things I wanted to do. For example white water rafting and ""cliff jumping"". What if I decide to do one of these activities? Do the companies providing those services insure?

travel,"Any advice for destinations with a cooler climate/weather from mid July–late August? Like light jacket weather ?Hi r/travel, I humbly come looking for some travel suggestions for cooler weather summer travel destinations. I dread the summer so much for the heat.  In Michigan (where I live) the heat peaks in mid-July and lasts through the end of August, so ideally in that month I'd like to travel to somewhere cooler to escape the heat and awful humidity. Something maybe that floats around the mid-60's°F (15°C)—ideally with low humidity ?

In Michigan the mosquitos get so godawful here too, and I'm very allergic to them, as well as I guess I have just what they want because they come after me in freaking swarms. I carry 100% deet in my bag soon as they start showing face. And that really doesn't help with the heat rash (I'm, like, literally allergic to summer) and the perpetual mild sunburn from being so pale. I'm just so itchy all summer, I'm miserable lol. So as a plus maybe somewhere not as really itchy ? 

(And it's probably a given) but a destination that's opportunistic in this month as well, if that makes sense ? Like it's not a totally ""not good"" time to visit ? I always rent a car and make a big road trip loop with a main destination in the middle of the loop that I'll stay for about 5 days or so, making stops on the way in and out. 

One more thing—I'm a girl out traveling by myself but I'm not sure that's as relevant, as I tend to mostly skip metro areas and prefer nature and hiking around on park trails. Although I always feel kind of inclined to be skeptical of what I read online about destinations being out of the question for girls traveling by themselves per safety anyways. 

Last year I went to Alaska during the aforementioned months and it was perfect timing as I also timed it to be when the mosquitos are also mostly gone, for example.

I've thought about Canada this summer, I haven't been before so I don't know what the climate is like around this month but I'm worried in the more southern parts it'll be similar to Michigan...! And that scares me away from the idea but r/travel probably might know better.","['Any', 'advice', 'for', 'destinations', 'with', 'cooler', 'climate', 'weather', 'from', 'mid', 'July', 'late',

climate is like around this month but worried in the more southern part it ll be similar to michigan and that scare me away from the idea but travel probably might know better

travel,"Planning a solo 2 week Europe itinerary - what should I choose next?Hi r/travel!

I have 2 weeks vacation and was planning on visiting Europe. I just can’t decide where! 

I’m 24 and this would be my first time doing hostel style travel. I work as a software engineer so I’m trying to get out and meet people. 

And although I don’t want to be partying 24/7, I do want to get out of my comfort zone and party a little. I never got to party in college. I want to do it while I’m still relatively young

Wants:

- Tons of sightseeing, beautiful views and architecture 
- Warm climate and beaches are a plus. But not totally required
- Good hostel/social scene (parties are a plus)

Idk how to narrow down the places I’m interested in seeing. Ive already been to Paris, London, Prague, and Vienna. So far the places that interest me are:

- Amsterdam, NL and nearby Belgium (Bruges, Ghent, Antwerp). Amsterdam seems cool because of all the museums and beautiful rivers, and Bruges just looks like straight out of a storybook.

- Berlin, Germany (heard great things about the clubs, but besides that doesn’t seem very interesting to me at first glance). Not as nice scenery. I could be wrong tho!

- Budapest, Hungary. Like Berlin with cool Ruin bars. But not as scenic as like Greek islands or parts of Spain/Italy. 

- Spain and Portugal in general. Feel like it has a good mix of beauty, party, sightseeing.

- Italy, same as Spain. Although I hear the hostel scene isn’t as good there?

- Greece, this looks so freaking beautiful (especially Santorini, but is it good for solo traveling or is more for couples?)

Others that seem cool: Scotland, Croatia, Slovenia, and Southern France.

Budget: $8,000 but I doubt I would get anywhere near that.","['Planning', 'solo', 'week', 'Europe', 'itinerary', 'what', 'should', 'choose', 'next', 'Hi', 'travel', 'have', 'weeks', 'vacation', 'and', 'was', 'planning', 'on', 'visiting', 'Europe', 'just', 'can', 'decide', 'where', 'and', 'this', 'would', 'be', 'my', 'first', 'time', 'doing', 'hostel', 'style', 'travel', 'work', 'as', 'software', 'engineer', 'so', 'trying', 'to', 'get', 'out', 'and', 'meet', 'people', 'And', 'although', 'don', 'want', 'to', 'be', 'partying', 'do', 'want', 'to', 'get', 'out', 'of', 'my', 'comfort', 'zone', 'and', 'party', 'little', 'never', 'got', 'to', 'party', 'in', 'college', 'want', 'to', 'do', 'it', 'while', 'still', 'relatively', 'young', 'Wants', 'Tons', 'of', 'sightseeing', 'beautiful', 'views', 'and', 'architecture', 'Warm', 'climate', 'and', 'beaches', 'are', 'plus', 'But', 'not', 'totally', 'required', 'Good', 'hostel', 'social', 'scene', 'parties', 'are', 'plus', 'Idk', 'how', 'to', 'narrow', 'down', 'the', 'places', 'interested', 'in', 'seeing', 'Ive', 'already', 'been', 'to', 'Paris', 'London', 'Prague', 'and', 'Vienna', 'So', 'far', 'the', 'places', 'that', 'interest', 'me', 'are', 'Amsterdam', 'NL', 'and', 'nearby', 'Belgium', 'Bruges', 'Ghent', 'Antwerp', 'Amsterdam', 'seems', 'cool', 'because', 'of', 'all', 'the', 'museums', 'and', 'beautiful', 'rivers', 'and', 'Bruges', 'just', 'looks', 'like', 'straight', 'out', 'of', 'storybook', 'Berlin', 'Germany', 'heard', 'great', 'things', 'about', 'the', 'clubs', 'but', 'besides', 'that', 'doesn', 'seem', 'very', 'interesting', 'to', 'me', 'at', 'first', 'glance', 'Not', 'as', 'nice', 'scenery', 'could', 'be', 'wrong', 'tho', 'Budapest', 'Hungary', 'Like', 'Berlin', 'with', 'cool', 'Ruin', 'bars', 'But', 'not', 'as', 'scenic', 'as', 'like', 'Greek', 'islands', 'or', 'parts', 'of', 'Spain', 'Italy', 'Spain', 'and', 'Portugal', 'in', 'general', 'Feel', 'like', 'it', 'has', 'good', 'mix', 'of', 'beauty', 'party', 'sightseeing', 'Italy', 'same', 'as', 'Spain', 'Although', 'hear', 'the', 'hostel', 'scene', 'isn', 'as', 'good', 'there', 'Greece', 'this', 'looks', 'so', 'freaking', 'beautiful', 'especially', 'Santorini', 'but', 'is', 'it', 'good', 'for', 'solo', 'traveling', 'or', 'is', 'more', 'for', 'couples', 'Others', 'that', 'seem', 'cool', 'Scotland', 'Croatia', 'Slovenia', 'and', 'Southern', 'France', 'Budget', 'but', 'doubt', 'would', 'get', 'anywhere', 'near', 'that']",planning solo week europe itinerary what should choose next hi travel have week vacation and wa planning on visiting europe just can decide where and this would be my first time doing hostel style travel work a software engineer so trying to get out and meet people and although don want to be partying do want to get out of my comfort zone and party little never got to party in college want to do it while still relatively young wants tons of sightseeing beautiful view and architecture warm climate and beach are plus but not totally required good hostel social scene party are plus idk how to narrow down the place interested in seeing ive already been to paris london prague and vienna so far the place that interest me are amsterdam nl and nearby belgium bruges ghent antwerp amsterdam seems cool because of all the museum and beautiful river and bruges just look like straight out of storybook berlin germany heard great thing about the club but besides that doesn seem very interesting to me at first glance not a nice scenery could be wrong tho budapest hungary like berlin with cool ruin bar but not a scenic a like greek island or part of spain italy spain and portugal in general feel like it ha good mix of beauty party sightseeing italy same a spain although hear the hostel scene isn a good there greece this look so freaking beautiful especially santorini but is it good for solo traveling or is more for couple others that seem cool scotland croatia slovenia and southern france budget but doubt would get anywhere near that

travel,"How would you spend 24 hours in Paris?On a Friday in July, I'll be landing around 9:45 AM and then catching a train to London the next day around 11 AM.  I will be staying at a hotel near Gare du Nord (unless there's a compelling argument to stay elsewhere).

I've been to Paris before and seen most of the big attractions so I expect I'll spend most of my time exploring, eating and maybe a little shopping.  I'll be travelling solo and getting around by foot, by metro and maybe Vélib' as well.

Here's my rough plan so far:

* Arrive at Gare du Nord around 11 AM and leave my luggage there
* Find something to do (1-2 hours)
* Have lunch at a bistro
* Get ice cream at Berthillon on Ile St Louis
* Check in to my hotel, wash up, maybe take a short nap
* Find something to do (~2-3 hours)
* Have dinner
* Find something to do (1-2 hours)
* Head to Trocadero, grab a crepe from a street vendor and watch the Eiffel Tower twinkle
* Grab a drink somewhere and then sleep
* Wake up around 7, enjoy a coffee and croissant on a terrasse somewhere near the hotel
* Explore the area for an hour or so, check out around 9:30 and catch my train

travel,"Phone issues for international travelMy wife and I are going to visit France from the US. I decided to get us Orange eSIMs because of cost and so we can talk while I'm doing work stuff and she's sightseeing.

My phone was falling apart so I called Verizon to make sure I could use a newly purchased phone with an eSIM (vs buying a temporary phone or their overpriced service) - as in it would be unlocked. they told me on the phone yes if I paid it off. I even remembered looking this information up... so I paid off the phone early vs using the month to month payments. I checked the Verizon automated chat agent thing to determine lock status- it changed from locked to 'your device is unlocked' after I paid it off.

Fast forward a month to today. I go to install the eSIM and sure enough it's locked. Apparently it's 60 days from purchase no matter what. Why did they lie to me... how did I miss that?

So it's looking like now my wife will have Orange France number and I'll have my US number for 3x the cost completely ruining the point as her calls/texts with me are still going to have to only be over Whatsapp to avoid the limits of the Orange eSIM international calls/texts (120min, 1000texts)

I'm probably overthinking it. An alternative is saying screw it and just fall all the way into the Verizon trap and get her an international plan as well and just keep bleeding money...

We want to visit a big city or two, but also visit some smaller towns as well. We’d love to experience some nature (mountains, forests, rivers, etc.). We don't plan on spending too much money, so things such as food, BEER (very important) and accommodation should be cheap wherever we're going.

Somewhere fairly easy to get to via plane from the UK is ideal and our budget isn't massive, so somewhere, semi-affordable is preferred.

I was glad to get so many useful suggestions based on which I came up with the following: itinerary

Day1- drive early AM from SFO to Yosemite valley. Check out the valley, small hikes with parents and drive down wawona road to Oakhurst. Hope the drive will be fine without the need for tire chains. I wish there were shuttles to mariposa Grove, my parents can't do the hike from visitor center. We'll rest at Oakhurst for the night. 

Day 2 - Drive from Oakhurst to Big Sur, explore the Pacific Coast highway and rest for the night in Monterey.

Day 3 - Drive back from Monterey to SFO, visit Golden gate and Muir woods the rest of the day before heading back to the airport. Our return flight is late at night.

I'm quite excited for this trip and hope it turns out great.

travel,"Best airline for business class/first class from East Coast USA to South Africa?I am planning a big bucket list trip in 2026 from East Coast (I'm in MD so most likely would want to leave from Dulles, but can travel to JFK/ATL  other surroundings) to South Africa- We haven't narrowed down the exact location we're heading to but most likely will be starting in Cape Town. 

My husband and some of our travel friends that will be joining are larger guys so it's important to have the bigger seats, especially for the long flight- we're looking at the Delta since they have the business class seats that make the long flight(s) easier. 

Because of how costly those business/first class seats are round trip my goal is to stockpile as many miles as I can with the airline prior to booking our flights- we have roughly (3) years to build up to use towards our trip- I'm just not sure if there's a different airline that's better suited or more widely used to travel to South Africa- I'd hate to spend (3) years stockpiling miles just to find out we need to book the flight through a different airline

travel,"50 and not left EuropeSo I 39 and come from England, UK. My partner who is also English is 10 years older than me and it is her 50th next year.

I have travelled a fair amount in Europe and have also been to Thailand, Gambia, Morocco and Egypt.

I want to take her somewhere for her 50th and not sure where to go.

I have thought about returning to Thailand as I would feel more confident or possibly Bali, Philippines, Malaysia or Jamaica.

travel,"Any advice for narrowing down locations to visit?Currently planning a trip for somewhere in Europe for late May/early June timeframe. So far I have tons of places I was considering visiting and I'm having a hard time narrowing it down. So far I have briefly traveled to London (over thanksgiving weekend), did a 10 day trip in Paris + Strasbourg, visited Prague + Vienna with my parents, and been to Kyiv, Ukraine (sigh). 

Budget: Very healthy but would still probably do hostels so that I can meet other solo travelers and the occasional hotel so that I can take a break from hostels

Length of trip: 2 weeks

Wants: Some partying (but not 24/7), easy to meet other solo travelers, beautiful architecture/walkable, good food, good city for someone in mid 20s, lots to see and do. I honestly feel like this is everywhere in Europe which is why it's so hard to narrow down my list. History is nice but not required.

My top 5 places I'm considering are: Greece, Spain, Italy, Turkey, and the Netherlands/Belgium (since they are so close together). These also were high on my list: Ireland, South of France, Portugal, Iceland (good for layover vacation).

I'm also planning on visiting family in Israel right before/after the trip which is why I thought Turkey would be super convenient, but honestly all the choices I have are pretty short plane ride anyway to/from Israel.

Any advice for narrowing down my list? Let me know if there's any other information I could provide you guys!

travel,"Taking the Greyhound bus for the first time as a single 23 year old female, tips?For my own safety, I won’t be posting departure dates/times. However, I’ve booked a ticket from MI - NY because any flight you try to find from DTW - JFK for the next three weeks is going to be no less than $400.

Ideally, I’m used to paying around half of that, that’s a nonstop with Delta. So with a Greyhound ticket being half of my ideal, I figured why not?

I’ll have someone waiting for me upon my arrival, I’m just worried about the trip there. Can I bring snacks? Lol. Is someone going to be next to me? Because I’d rather just throw my bag up and sit alone. Which is pretty pretentious considering it’s a public fucking bus. I suck, I know.

How lightly should I pack? I’m debating between a duffel bag or a small carry on. Where’s the best place to sit? Should I avoid bathroom breaks? 😭 I feel like I’m overthinking this but at the same time I’ve heard some wild stories from people in the past.

travel,"Schengen visaHi guys !

I applied for a Schengen visa not long ago and my interview is tomorrow.
I have a few questions:

A few years ago I did get the Schengen visa (5 years) I was a minor so my parents took care of everything but I don’t remember when it expired because we got rid of our old passports.

When I was applying they asked me if in the last 5 years I received the Schengen visa and to state the date it expired and since I don’t remember I had to say I didn’t receive Schengen visa in the last 5 years. 

My old Schengen visa expired 2018 I think ( I don’t know the exact date) so it has been 4 years.Is that okay or will I have to explain that in the interview?

For the financial record they ask at least 3000€ over at least the 3 last months. Does that mean that every month my closing balance needs to show 3000? (My first statement is 7000cad second one is 200$ and third one is 5000$)

Other than that all my documents are complete.

I’m travelling the 14th of May so I’m hoping that I’ll get my visa in max 2 weeks 🤞🏻

travel,"icelandair carry-on dimensions help?I'm flying iceland air in a couple weeks and I've had to buy my first suitcase (yay!) I was worried about it being to big and it is, because of the wheels. The dimensions for icelandair are 21.6×15.7×7.8 inches. The one I got was advertised as 21inches but, suprise, that didn't include the wheels. After i measured it the dimensions are 24×14.5×9 and i feel like that pushes the ""max"" too much. Finding a decent suitcase has been the most frustrating part of this whole thing. What store do you guys find suitcases? I'm thinking about a backpack but I like suitcases better because they're easier to organize and have a bit more space. I don't want to risk having a suitcase that's too big because checking a bag gives me anxiety✨️

Now, she and I don't have any intentions of having sexual relations with each other while I'm there. The trip is mainly to just catch up on each other's lives while she shows me around for my vacation.

travel,"Are travel groups a good way to meet new people/make friends while traveling?I've been planning on traveling internationally for my spring break next year and an option that I've been keen on is traveling with a group, as I'd be able to both travel, as well as meet new people to share the experience with. EF Ultimate Break and Intrepid Travel are some of the more popular examples of these travel organizations that work in groups. The title pretty much sums it up but I'm wondering if going on these trips would allow me to meet new people and make friends, or because I'd be a solo traveller and don't know anybody else in the group, if it would be difficult.

Also I'm asking on here because from what I've heard, a lot of these group travel companies either give out monetary bonuses to positive reviews or exclude negative reviews from their websites. This can make it hard to find objective opinions on these organizations.

travel,"13 day Itinerary in PortugalHi all,

My wife and I will be traveling to Portugal for 13 days in late August/early September and I've created a rough itinerary that I'd like to get your opinion on! A few things before I get started,

\- We are flying in and out of Lisbon. After researching a bit, I attempted to change it so we flew out of Porto instead, however British Airways will not let us adjust our flight :(

\- I'm sure it looks like we are not spending enough time in Lisbon, but I wanted to create a rough guide to see as much as the country as possible. Please tell me if you think certain areas should be cut or if I should spend more time elsewhere. I want to be as efficient with my time as possible so that we don't feel rush traveling through the country.

\- I've already realized I probably won't be able to travel back to Lisbon from Porto the morning of the flight as google maps is saying its a 3 hour trip. I left it in the itinerary to see if there was a faster train that could get us back in time for our 11 am flight to London. If not we will travel back the night before

\- We are traveling from the US

\- This is just a general route, we will figure out hard details after settling on rough guide

Here we go!

Quick Summary

Lisbon + Sintra 3 days (2 days Lisbon plus day trip to Sintra)

travel,"Travelling to Italy in May. Have concerns about train strike on my first day 

Hi [r/t](https://www.reddit.com/r/italy/)ravel! I will be doing a 9 day tour of Italy! Its my first time going there and I am really excited!

I have a conference in Switzerland prior to the trip and plan to take the train down through the Alps to Milan on Friday May 20th. However, when looking at trains on trainline, there is a notice that indicates there will be a strike that lasts from the 19th to the 20th.

&gt;Sciopero nazionale - Italo, Trenitalia, Trenord, intera giornata: aereo 00.01-24.00; ferrov. da 21.00 del 19/5 a 21.00 del 20/5; tpl 24 ore con modalita' territoriali; marittimo isole maggiori 24 ore da 1 ora prima partenza, isole minori 00.01-24.00; autostrade da 22.00 del 19/5 a 22.00 del 20/5. CUB, SGB

How concerned should I be? My understanding is that the trains still run but on ""essential services only"". What does that mean? Based on the routes I've found via trainline, the portion of the trip that is run by Trenitalia is from Sion/Brig.

I haven't booked any trains yet. My issue is that I need to be in Rome on the morning of the 21st to meet up with my buddy. So my plan was to take a train to Milan, spend a night there, then train/fly to Rome in the morning.

Also I'd gladly welcome any advice you have on our itinerary: First 4 days: Serrento/Amalfi coast area (plan to spend time on the beach, go see Pompeii/Mt. Vesuvius, maybe go to Capri), next 3 days: Rome (Vatican, Coliseum, explore the city), 1 day in Florence/Venice, train through alps to Innsbruck then fly home from Munich.

travel,"Am I going to restaurants in Europe wrong?Hey.   So I'm a non-White American in Spain with my non-White family. We have   been here about a week, and we have already have 6 unpleasant   experiences at restaurants. Basically, we  go to a restaurant and  they  seat us. Then they don't give us a menu for 30-45 minutes. We see   people seated after us who get served their food/drinks before us. This   has happened 6 times already. After 30 minutes, we usually leave. On a   couple occassions, we just stayed as long as needed to see what would   happen, and we were served after 45min.

My   Asian-American friend is in Italy with her family, and has experienced   the exact same scenario. Get seated, wait 30-45 mins before getting a   menu even though other people who are seated AFTER them get their food.

I'm   going to be as opened minded and as understand as possible. Please   trust I am sincere. What is going on here? My mind, as an American, is   rushing to racism. But I also know that the romance countries are known   for a slower pace of life. If you tell me waiting 30-45min before   getting a menu is ""normal,"" then I get it. I won't think of this again   and just re-adjust my expectations. But what bothers me is people seated   AFTER us are getting served before us.

Is   this racism, or am I overreacting? This is really ruining our vacation   and making us afraid of going out (i.e we are afraid this could  escalate  to racial violence). But I recognize I may just not understand  a  cultural difference. I'd appreciate any help. Thanks!

Edit:  Also, maybe I don't know how to ""go to a restaurant"" in Europe? In the   US, we typically go to the front of the restaurant and stand. Then the   waiter comes to us within 5mins and seats us. Then we look at the menu   and they waiter comes back to take our order. Is that wrong in   Spain/Italy? Like maybe I'm supposed to yell ""excuse me"" (in spanish)   when I walk in, then to wave my hand when I'm ready to order instead of   waiting for them to come?

As a note: I don't know Spanish, but in the US, anti-language = racism (i.e. not serving oyu because they dont want to deal with the language barrier would be considered a racial hate crime in the US.

Basically my question is does anyone have any recommendations on where to go and what to do? What cities and towns should I visit and about how much do you think I’d spend on experiences as well as transportation and what type of transportation should I look for ( busses/trains/Uber). Where are places I should avoid be it shops/stores/ restaurants. Also what towns/cities/areas should I avoid?","['This', 'is', 'my', 'first', 'time', 'traveling', 'alone', 'and', 'need', 'some', 'adviceI', 'live', 'in', 'the', 'US', 'in', 'North', 'Carolina', 'and', 'am', 'attempting', 'to', 'go', 'on', 'solo', 'trip', 'to', 'the', 'UK', 'this', 'summer', 've', 'looked', 'through', 'flight', 'information', 'and', 'it', 'seems', 'like', 'flying', 'out', 'of', 'New', 'York', 'is', 'one', 'of', 'the', 'cheapest', 'options', 'This', 'would', 'be', 'two', 'week', 'trip', 'and', 'like', 'it', 'to', 'go', 'from', 'Wednesday', 'June', '29th', 'to', 'July', '12th', 'since', 'like', 'to', 'experience', 'day', 'or', 'two', 'in', 'London', 'for', 'pride', 'have', 'around', 'saved', 'up', 'for', 'the', 'trip', 'but', 'would', 'prefer', 'to', 'only', 'have', 'to', 'use', 'about', 'since', 'also', 'saving', 'up', 'for', 'van', 'life', 'as', 'well', 'as', 'potential', 'emergency', 'costs', 've', 'been', 'all', 'throughout', 'Mexico', 'and', 'South', 'America', 'with', 'family', 'and', 'friends', 'love', 'the', 'people', 'and', 'experiences', 've', 'had', 'there', 'as', 'well', 'as', 'the', 'food', 'yet', 'haven', 'been', 'over', 'seas', 'nor', 'been', 'anywhere', 'alone', 've', 'been', 'finding', 'it', 'difficult', 'to', 'plan', 'experiences', 'like', 'to', 'go', 'places', 'that', 'can', 'meet', 'people', 'preferably', 'younger', 'people', 'clubs', 'bars', 'pubs', 'love', 'nature', 'and', 'cities', 'and', 'would', 'love', 'to', 'experience', 'both', 'and', 'since', 'going', 'so', 'long', 'have', 'the', 'ability', 'to', 'Basically', 'my', 'question', 'is', 'does', 'anyone', 'have', 'any', 'recommendations', 'on', 'where', 'to', 'go', 'and', 'what', 'to', 'do', 'What', 'cities', 'and', 'towns', 'should', 'visit', 'and', 'about', 'how', 'much', 'do', 'you', 'think', 'spend', 'on', 'experiences', 'as', 'well', 'as', 'transportation', 'and', 'what', 'type', 'of', 'transportation', 'should', 'look', 'for', 'busses', 'trains', 'Uber', 'Where', 'are', 'places', 'should', 'avoid', 'be', 'it', 'shops', 'stores', 'restaurants', 'Also', 'what', 'towns', 'cities', 'areas', 'should', 'avoid']",this is my first time traveling alone and need some advicei live in the us in north carolina and am attempting to go on solo trip to the uk this summer ve looked through flight information and it seems like flying out of new york is one of the cheapest option this would be two week trip and like it to go from wednesday june 29th to july 12th since like to experience day or two in london for pride have around saved up for the trip but would prefer to only have to use about since also saving up for van life a well a potential emergency cost ve been all throughout mexico and south america with family and friend love the people and experience ve had there a well a the food yet haven been over sea nor been anywhere alone ve been finding it difficult to plan experience like to go place that can meet people preferably younger people club bar pub love nature and city and would love to experience both and since going so long have the ability to basically my question is doe anyone have any recommendation on where to go and what to do what city and town should visit and about how much do you think spend on experience a well a transportation and what type of transportation should look for bus train uber where are place should avoid be it shop store restaurant also what town city area should avoid
travel,"Deciding where to go for a 10 day euro tripGoing to Europe in October and just wanted some advice for the best course of action. We’re looking to see as many places as possible on the euro rail but want to see from other people if it’s too much to do 7 destinations in 10 days.

Originally I was thinking fly to Barcelona, then Rome, Venice, Swiss alps, Berlin, Amsterdam, London then fly home. Is that too much traveling?

Or should we stick with a region and do a couple of countries?

We’re mainly going for the views and culture and the night time scene somewhere during one of the weekends we’re there. I’m not asking for a whole itinerary, but just curious from others experience what the best course of action is. We’re mainly going to stay in hostels when we can if we’re not sleeping on the train.","['Deciding', 'where', 'to', 'go', 'for', 'day', 'euro', 'tripGoing', 'to', 'Europe', 'in', 'October', 'and', 'just', 'wanted', 'some', 'advice', 'for', 'the', 'best', 'course', 'of', 'action', 'We', 're', 'looking', 'to', 'see', 'as', 'many', 'places', 'as', 'possible', 'on', 'the', 'euro', 'rail', 'but', 'want', 'to', 'see', 'from', 'other', 'people', 'if', 'it', 'too', 'much', 'to', 'do', 'destinations', 'in', 'days', 'Originally', 'was', 'thinking', 'fly', 'to', 'Barcelona', 'then', 'Rome', 'Venice', 'Swiss', 'alps', 'Berlin', 'Amsterdam', 'London', 'then', 'fly', 'home', 'Is', 'that', 'too', 'much', 'traveling', 'Or', 'should', 'we', 'stick', 'with', 'region', 'and', 'do', 'couple', 'of', 'countries', 'We', 're', 'mainly', 'going', 'for', 'the', 'views', 'and', 'culture', 'and', 'the', 'night', 'time', 'scene', 'somewhere', 'during', 'one', 'of', 'the', 'weekends', 'we', 're', 'there', 'not', 'asking', 'for', 'whole', 'itinerary', 'but', 'just', 'curious', 'from', 'others', 'experience', 'what', 'the', 'best', 'course', 'of', 'action', 'is', 'We', 're', 'mainly', 'going', 'to', 'stay', 'in', 'hostels', 'when', 'we', 'can', 'if', 'we', 're', 'not', 'sleeping', 'on', 'the', 'train']",deciding where to go for day euro tripgoing to europe in october and just wanted some advice for the best course of action we re looking to see a many place a possible on the euro rail but want to see from other people if it too much to do destination in day originally wa thinking fly to barcelona then rome venice swiss alp berlin amsterdam london then fly home is that too much traveling or should we stick with region and do couple of country we re mainly going for the view and culture and the night time scene somewhere during one of the weekend we re there not asking for whole itinerary but just curious from others experience what the best course of action is we re mainly going to stay in hostel when we can if we re not sleeping on the train
travel,"Feedback on Korea/Japan itinerary: Let me know what you loved about these places!My husband and I are travelling around Korea and Japan for a couple of weeks before joining my family for a skiing trip. We've spent one day together in Seoul in the past, and absolutely loved it! I've been to Tokyo before, but he has never been. 

We were originally going to spend a few days in Seoul and a few days in Busan, but we decided against that as we will go back to Korea again and we want to spend more time in one place and have made the mistake of overcrowded trips in the past. 

We are big foodies and into arts/culture. Let me know if you have any feedback! Yes, I know about Japan's borders but let's pretend that isn't an issue here. I like to overplan ideas for each day when I'm planning my itinerary as I find it helps me get more out of the holiday and gives me things to look forward to! On the actual trip, some get skipped or changed. The Osaka part of the trip is probably the least fleshed out. 

I'm also not sure if the JR pass is worth it for us. I've added up the cost of our individual trips and it looks like it is cheaper to NOT get the pass, but I'm not sure if I'm missing something important.
